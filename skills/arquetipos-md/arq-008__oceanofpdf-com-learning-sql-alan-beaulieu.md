Preface
Programming languages come and go constantly, and
very few languages in use today have roots going back
more than a decade or so. Some examples are Cobol,
which is still used quite heavily in mainframe
environments, and C, which is still quite popular for
operating system and server development and for
embedded systems. In the database arena, we have SQL,
whose roots go all the way back to the 1970s.
SQL is the language for generating, manipulating, and
retrieving data from a relational database. One of the
reasons for the popularity of relational databases is that
properly designed relational databases can handle huge
amounts of data. When working with large data sets, SQL
is akin to one of those snazzy digital cameras with the
high-power zoom lens in that you can use SQL to look at
large sets of data, or you can zoom in on individual rows
(or anywhere in between). Other database management
systems tend to break down under heavy loads because
their focus is too narrow (the zoom lens is stuck on
maximum), which is why attempts to dethrone relational
databases and SQL have largely failed. Therefore, even
though SQL is an old language, it is going to be around
for a lot longer and has a bright future in store.
Why Learn SQL?
If you are going to work with a relational database,
whether you are writing applications, performing
administrative tasks, or generating reports, you will need
to know how to interact with the data in your database.
Even if you are using a tool that generates SQL for you,
such as a reporting tool, there may be times when you
need to bypass the automatic generation feature and
write your own SQL statements.
Learning SQL has the added benefit of forcing you to
confront and understand the data structures used to
store information about your organization. As you
become comfortable with the tables in your database,

you may find yourself proposing modifications or
additions to your database schema.

Why Use This Book to Do It?
The SQL language is broken into several categories.
Statements used to create database objects (tables,
indexes, constraints, etc.) are collectively known as SQL
schema statements. The statements used to create,
manipulate, and retrieve the data stored in a database
are known as the SQL data statements. If you are an
administrator, you will be using both SQL schema and
SQL data statements. If you are a programmer or report
writer, you may only need to use (or be allowed to use)
SQL data statements. While this book demonstrates
many of the SQL schema statements, the main focus of
this book is on programming features.
With only a handful of commands, the SQL data
statements look deceptively simple. In my opinion, many
of the available SQL books help to foster this notion by
only skimming the surface of what is possible with the
language. However, if you are going to work with SQL, it
behooves you to understand fully the capabilities of the
language and how different features can be combined to
produce powerful results. I feel that this is the only book
that provides detailed coverage of the SQL language
without the added benefit of doubling as a “door stop”
(you know, those 1,250-page “complete references” that
tend to gather dust on people’s cubicle shelves).
While the examples in this book run on MySQL, Oracle
Database, and SQL Server, I had to pick one of those
products to host my sample database and to format the
result sets returned by the example queries. Of the three,
I chose MySQL because it is freely obtainable, easy to
install, and simple to administer. For those readers using
a different server, I ask that you download and install
MySQL and load the sample database so that you can run
the examples and experiment with the data.

Chapter 1. A Little Background
Before we roll up our sleeves and get to work, it might be
beneficial to introduce some basic database concepts and
look at the history of computerized data storage and
retrieval.
Introduction to Databases
A database is nothing more than a set of related
information. A telephone book, for example, is a database
of the names, phone numbers, and addresses of all
people living in a particular region. While a telephone
book is certainly a ubiquitous and frequently used
database, it suffers from the following:
Finding a person’s telephone number can be time-
consuming, especially if the telephone book contains
a large number of entries.
A telephone book is indexed only by last/first names,
so finding the names of the people living at a
particular address, while possible in theory, is not a
practical use for this database.
From the moment the telephone book is printed, the
information becomes less and less accurate as people
move into or out of a region, change their telephone
numbers, or move to another location within the
same region.
The same drawbacks attributed to telephone books can
also apply to any manual data storage system, such as
patient records stored in a filing cabinet. Because of the
cumbersome nature of paper databases, some of the first
computer applications developed were database systems,
which are computerized data storage and retrieval
mechanisms. Because a database system stores data
electronically rather than on paper, a database system is
able to retrieve data more quickly, index data in multiple
ways, and deliver up-to-the-minute information to its user
community.
Early database systems managed data stored on
magnetic tapes. Because there were generally far more
tapes than tape readers, technicians were tasked with

loading and unloading tapes as specific data was
requested. Because the computers of that era had very
little memory, multiple requests for the same data
generally required the data to be read from the tape
multiple times. While these database systems were a
significant improvement over paper databases, they are a
far cry from what is possible with today’s technology.
(Modern database systems can manage terabytes of data
spread across many fast-access disk drives, holding tens
of gigabytes of that data in high-speed memory, but I’m
getting a bit ahead of myself.)
Nonrelational Database Systems
Note ✎
This section contains some background information
about pre-relational database systems. For those
readers eager to dive into SQL, feel free to skip
ahead a couple of pages to the next section.
Over the first several decades of computerized database
systems, data was stored and represented to users in
various ways. In a hierarchical database system, for
example, data is represented as one or more tree
structures. Figure 1-1 shows how data relating to George
Blake’s and Sue Smith’s bank accounts might be
represented via tree structures.

Figure 1-1. Hierarchical view of account data
George and Sue each have their own tree containing
their accounts and the transactions on those accounts.
The hierarchical database system provides tools for
locating a particular customer’s tree and then traversing
the tree to find the desired accounts and/or transactions.
Each node in the tree may have either zero or one parent
and zero, one, or many children. This configuration is
known as a single-parent hierarchy.
Another common approach, called the network database
system, exposes sets of records and sets of links that
define relationships between different records. Figure 1-
2 shows how George’s and Sue’s same accounts might
look in such a system.

Figure 1-2. Network view of account data
In order to find the transactions posted to Sue’s money
market account, you would need to perform the following
steps:
1. Find the customer record for Sue Smith.
2. Follow the link from Sue Smith’s customer record to
her list of accounts.
3. Traverse the chain of accounts until you find the
money market account.
4. Follow the link from the money market record to its
list of transactions.
One interesting feature of network database systems is
demonstrated by the set of product records on the far
right of Figure 1-2. Notice that each product record
(Checking, Savings, etc.) points to a list of account
records that are of that product type. Account records,
therefore, can be accessed from multiple places (both
customer records and product records), allowing a
network database to act as a multiparent hierarchy.

Both hierarchical and network database systems are
alive and well today, although generally in the mainframe
world. Additionally, hierarchical database systems have
enjoyed a rebirth in the directory services realm, such as
Microsoft’s Active Directory and the Red Hat Directory
Server, as well as with Extensible Markup Language
(XML). Beginning in the 1970s, however, a new way of
representing data began to take root, one that was more
rigorous yet easy to understand and implement.
The Relational Model
In 1970, Dr. E. F. Codd of IBM’s research laboratory
published a paper titled “A Relational Model of Data for
Large Shared Data Banks” that proposed that data be
represented as sets of tables. Rather than using pointers
to navigate between related entities, redundant data is
used to link records in different tables. Figure 1-3 shows
how George’s and Sue’s account information would
appear in this context.

Figure 1-3. Relational view of account data
There are four tables in Figure 1-3 representing the four
entities discussed so far: customer, product, account,
and transaction. Looking across the top of the
customer table in Figure 1-3, you can see three columns:
cust_id (which contains the customer’s ID number),
fname (which contains the customer’s first name), and
lname (which contains the customer’s last name).
Looking down the side of the customer table, you can see
two rows, one containing George Blake’s data and the
other containing Sue Smith’s data. The number of
columns that a table may contain differs from server to
server, but it is generally large enough not to be an issue
(Microsoft SQL Server, for example, allows up to 1,024

columns per table). The number of rows that a table may
contain is more a matter of physical limits (i.e., how
much disk drive space is available) and maintainability
(i.e., how large a table can get before it becomes difficult
to work with) than of database server limitations.
Each table in a relational database includes information
that uniquely identifies a row in that table (known as the
primary key), along with additional information needed
to describe the entity completely. Looking again at the
customer table, the cust_id column holds a different
number for each customer; George Blake, for example,
can be uniquely identified by customer ID #1. No other
customer will ever be assigned that identifier, and no
other information is needed to locate George Blake’s
data in the customer table.
Note ✎
Every database server provides a mechanism for
generating unique sets of numbers to use as primary
key values, so you won’t need to worry about keeping
track of what numbers have been assigned.
While I might have chosen to use the combination of the
fname and lname columns as the primary key (a primary
key consisting of two or more columns is known as a
compound key), there could easily be two or more people
with the same first and last names that have accounts at
the bank. Therefore, I chose to include the cust_id
column in the customer table specifically for use as a
primary key column.

Note ✎
In this example, choosing fname/lname as the primary
key would be referred to as a natural key, whereas
the choice of cust_id would be referred to as a
surrogate key. The decision whether to employ
natural or surrogate keys is a topic of widespread
debate, but in this particular case the choice is clear,
since a person’s last name may change (such as when
a person adopts a spouse’s last name), and primary
key columns should never be allowed to change once
a value has been assigned.
Some of the tables also include information used to
navigate to another table; this is where the “redundant
data” mentioned earlier comes in. For example, the
account table includes a column called cust_id, which
contains the unique identifier of the customer who
opened the account, along with a column called
product_cd, which contains the unique identifier of the
product to which the account will conform. These
columns are known as foreign keys, and they serve the
same purpose as the lines that connect the entities in the
hierarchical and network versions of the account
information. If you are looking at a particular account
record and want to know more information about the
customer who opened the account, you would take the
value of the cust_id column and use it to find the
appropriate row in the customer table (this process is
known, in relational database lingo, as a join; joins are
introduced in Chapter 3 and probed deeply in Chapters 5
and 10).
It might seem wasteful to store the same data many
times, but the relational model is quite clear on what
redundant data may be stored. For example, it is proper
for the account table to include a column for the unique
identifier of the customer who opened the account, but it
is not proper to include the customer’s first and last
names in the account table as well. If a customer were to
change her name, for example, you want to make sure

that there is only one place in the database that holds the
customer’s name; otherwise, the data might be changed
in one place but not another, causing the data in the
database to be unreliable. The proper place for this data
is the customer table, and only the cust_id values
should be included in other tables. It is also not proper
for a single column to contain multiple pieces of
information, such as a name column that contains both a
person’s first and last names, or an address column that
contains street, city, state, and zip code information. The
process of refining a database design to ensure that each
independent piece of information is in only one place
(except for foreign keys) is known as normalization.
Getting back to the four tables in Figure 1-3, you may
wonder how you would use these tables to find George
Blake’s transactions against his checking account. First,
you would find George Blake’s unique identifier in the
customer table. Then, you would find the row in the
account table whose cust_id column contains George’s
unique identifier and whose product_cd column matches
the row in the product table whose name column equals
“Checking.” Finally, you would locate the rows in the
transaction table whose account_id column matches
the unique identifier from the account table. This might
sound complicated, but you can do it in a single
command, using the SQL language, as you will see
shortly.
Some Terminology
I introduced some new terminology in the previous
sections, so maybe it’s time for some formal definitions.
Table 1-1 shows the terms we use for the remainder of
the book along with their definitions.
Table 1-1. Terms and definitions
Term Definition
Entity Something of interest to the database user community. Examples
include customers, parts, geographic locations, etc.
Column An individual piece of data stored in a table.

Term Definition
Row A set of columns that together completely describe an entity or
some action on an entity. Also called a record.
Table A set of rows, held either in memory (nonpersistent) or on
permanent storage (persistent).
Result Another name for a nonpersistent table, generally the result of an
set SQL query.
Primary One or more columns that can be used as a unique identifier for
key each row in a table.
Foreign One or more columns that can be used together to identify a
key single row in another table.

What Is SQL?
Along with Codd’s definition of the relational model, he
proposed a language called DSL/Alpha for manipulating
the data in relational tables. Shortly after Codd’s paper
was released, IBM commissioned a group to build a
prototype based on Codd’s ideas. This group created a
simplified version of DSL/Alpha that they called
SQUARE. Refinements to SQUARE led to a language
called SEQUEL, which was, finally, renamed SQL.
SQL is now entering middle age (as is this author, alas),
and it has undergone a great deal of change along the
way. In the mid-1980s, the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) began working on the first standard for
the SQL language, which was published in 1986.
Subsequent refinements led to new releases of the SQL
standard in 1989, 1992, 1999, 2003, and 2006. Along
with refinements to the core language, new features have
been added to the SQL language to incorporate object-
oriented functionality, among other things. The latest
standard, SQL:2006, focuses on the integration of SQL
and XML and defines a language called XQuery which is
used to query data in XML documents.
SQL goes hand in hand with the relational model because
the result of an SQL query is a table (also called, in this
context, a result set). Thus, a new permanent table can
be created in a relational database simply by storing the
result set of a query. Similarly, a query can use both
permanent tables and the result sets from other queries
as inputs (we explore this in detail in Chapter 9).
One final note: SQL is not an acronym for anything
(although many people will insist it stands for
“Structured Query Language”). When referring to the
language, it is equally acceptable to say the letters
individually (i.e., S. Q. L.) or to use the word sequel.
SQL Statement Classes
The SQL language is divided into several distinct parts:
the parts that we explore in this book include SQL
schema statements, which are used to define the data

structures stored in the database; SQL data statements,
which are used to manipulate the data structures
previously defined using SQL schema statements; and
SQL transaction statements, which are used to begin,
end, and roll back transactions (covered in Chapter 12).
For example, to create a new table in your database, you
would use the SQL schema statement create table,
whereas the process of populating your new table with
data would require the SQL data statement insert.
To give you a taste of what these statements look like,
here’s an SQL schema statement that creates a table
called corporation:
CREATE TABLE corporation
(corp_id SMALLINT,
name VARCHAR(30),
CONSTRAINT pk_corporation PRIMARY KEY (corp_id)
);
This statement creates a table with two columns,
corp_id and name, with the corp_id column identified as
the primary key for the table. We probe the finer details
of this statement, such as the different data types
available with MySQL, in Chapter 2. Next, here’s an SQL
data statement that inserts a row into the corporation
table for Acme Paper Corporation:
INSERT INTO corporation (corp_id, name)
VALUES (27, 'Acme Paper Corporation');
This statement adds a row to the corporation table with
a value of 27 for the corp_id column and a value of Acme
Paper Corporation for the name column.
Finally, here’s a simple select statement to retrieve the
data that was just created:
mysql< SELECT name
-> FROM corporation
-> WHERE corp_id = 27;
+------------------------+
| name |
+------------------------+
| Acme Paper Corporation |
+------------------------+
All database elements created via SQL schema
statements are stored in a special set of tables called the
data dictionary. This “data about the database” is known

collectively as metadata and is explored in Chapter 15.
Just like tables that you create yourself, data dictionary
tables can be queried via a select statement, thereby
allowing you to discover the current data structures
deployed in the database at runtime. For example, if you
are asked to write a report showing the new accounts
created last month, you could either hardcode the names
of the columns in the account table that were known to
you when you wrote the report, or query the data
dictionary to determine the current set of columns and
dynamically generate the report each time it is executed.
Most of this book is concerned with the data portion of
the SQL language, which consists of the select, update,
insert, and delete commands. SQL schema statements
is demonstrated in Chapter 2, where the sample
database used throughout this book is generated. In
general, SQL schema statements do not require much
discussion apart from their syntax, whereas SQL data
statements, while few in number, offer numerous
opportunities for detailed study. Therefore, while I try to
introduce you to many of the SQL schema statements,
most chapters in this book concentrate on the SQL data
statements.
SQL: A Nonprocedural Language
If you have worked with programming languages in the
past, you are used to defining variables and data
structures, using conditional logic (i.e., if-then-else) and
looping constructs (i.e., do while ... end), and breaking
your code into small, reusable pieces (i.e., objects,
functions, procedures). Your code is handed to a
compiler, and the executable that results does exactly
(well, not always exactly) what you programmed it to do.
Whether you work with Java, C#, C, Visual Basic, or
some other procedural language, you are in complete
control of what the program does.

Note ✎
A procedural language defines both the desired
results and the mechanism, or process, by which the
results are generated. Nonprocedural languages also
define the desired results, but the process by which
the results are generated is left to an external agent.
With SQL, however, you will need to give up some of the
control you are used to, because SQL statements define
the necessary inputs and outputs, but the manner in
which a statement is executed is left to a component of
your database engine known as the optimizer. The
optimizer’s job is to look at your SQL statements and,
taking into account how your tables are configured and
what indexes are available, decide the most efficient
execution path (well, not always the most efficient). Most
database engines will allow you to influence the
optimizer’s decisions by specifying optimizer hints, such
as suggesting that a particular index be used; most SQL
users, however, will never get to this level of
sophistication and will leave such tweaking to their
database administrator or performance expert.
With SQL, therefore, you will not be able to write
complete applications. Unless you are writing a simple
script to manipulate certain data, you will need to
integrate SQL with your favorite programming language.
Some database vendors have done this for you, such as
Oracle’s PL/SQL language, MySQL’s stored procedure
language, and Microsoft’s Transact-SQL language. With
these languages, the SQL data statements are part of the
language’s grammar, allowing you to seamlessly
integrate database queries with procedural commands. If
you are using a non-database-specific language such as
Java, however, you will need to use a toolkit/API to
execute SQL statements from your code. Some of these
toolkits are provided by your database vendor, whereas
others are created by third-party vendors or by open
source providers. Table 1-2 shows some of the available
options for integrating SQL into a specific language.

Table 1-2. SQL integration toolkits

Interface (IBM)
C# ADO.NET (Microsoft)
Perl Perl DBI
Python Python DB
Visual ADO.NET (Microsoft)
Basic
If you only need to execute SQL commands interactively,
every database vendor provides at least a simple
command-line tool for submitting SQL commands to the
database engine and inspecting the results. Most vendors
provide a graphical tool as well that includes one window
showing your SQL commands and another window
showing the results from your SQL commands. Since the
examples in this book are executed against a MySQL
database, I use the mysql command-line tool that is
included as part of the MySQL installation to run the
examples and format the results.
SQL Examples
Earlier in this chapter, I promised to show you an SQL
statement that would return all the transactions against
George Blake’s checking account. Without further ado,
here it is:
SELECT t.txn_id, t.txn_type_cd, t.txn_date, t.amount
FROM individual i
INNER JOIN account a ON i.cust_id = a.cust_id
INNER JOIN product p ON p.product_cd = a.product_cd
INNER JOIN transaction t ON t.account_id = a.account_id
WHERE i.fname = 'George' AND i.lname = 'Blake'
AND p.name = 'checking account';
+--------+-------------+---------------------+--------+
| txn_id | txn_type_cd | txn_date | amount |

1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Without going into too much detail at this point, this
query identifies the row in the individual table for
George Blake and the row in the product table for the
“checking” product, finds the row in the account table
for this individual/product combination, and returns four
columns from the transaction table for all transactions
posted to this account. If you happen to know that
George Blake’s customer ID is 8 and that checking
accounts are designated by the code 'CHK', then you can
simply find George Blake’s checking account in the
account table based on the customer ID and use the
account ID to find the appropriate transactions:
SELECT t.txn_id, t.txn_type_cd, t.txn_date, t.amount
FROM account a
INNER JOIN transaction t ON t.account_id = a.account_id
WHERE a.cust_id = 8 AND a.product_cd = 'CHK';
I cover all of the concepts in these queries (plus a lot
more) in the following chapters, but I wanted to at least
show what they would look like.
The previous queries contain three different clauses:
select, from, and where. Almost every query that you
encounter will include at least these three clauses,
although there are several more that can be used for
more specialized purposes. The role of each of these
three clauses is demonstrated by the following:
SELECT /* one or more things */ ...
FROM /* one or more places */ ...
WHERE /* one or more conditions apply */ ...
Note ✎
Most SQL implementations treat any text between
the /* and */ tags as comments.
When constructing your query, your first task is generally
to determine which table or tables will be needed and
then add them to your from clause. Next, you will need to
add conditions to your where clause to filter out the data
from these tables that you aren’t interested in. Finally,
you will decide which columns from the different tables
need to be retrieved and add them to your select clause.

Here’s a simple example that shows how you would find
all customers with the last name “Smith”:
SELECT cust_id, fname
FROM individual
WHERE lname = 'Smith';
This query searches the individual table for all rows
whose lname column matches the string 'Smith' and
returns the cust_id and fname columns from those rows.
Along with querying your database, you will most likely
be involved with populating and modifying the data in
your database. Here’s a simple example of how you
would insert a new row into the product table:
INSERT INTO product (product_cd, name)
VALUES ('CD', 'Certificate of Depysit')
Whoops, looks like you misspelled “Deposit.” No
problem. You can clean that up with an update
statement:
UPDATE product
SET name = 'Certificate of Deposit'
WHERE product_cd = 'CD';
Notice that the update statement also contains a where
clause, just like the select statement. This is because an
update statement must identify the rows to be modified;
in this case, you are specifying that only those rows
whose product_cd column matches the string 'CD'
should be modified. Since the product_cd column is the
primary key for the product table, you should expect
your update statement to modify exactly one row (or
zero, if the value doesn’t exist in the table). Whenever
you execute an SQL data statement, you will receive
feedback from the database engine as to how many rows
were affected by your statement. If you are using an
interactive tool such as the mysql command-line tool
mentioned earlier, then you will receive feedback
concerning how many rows were either:
Returned by your select statement
Created by your insert statement
Modified by your update statement
Removed by your delete statement

If you are using a procedural language with one of the
toolkits mentioned earlier, the toolkit will include a call
to ask for this information after your SQL data statement
has executed. In general, it’s a good idea to check this
info to make sure your statement didn’t do something
unexpected (like when you forget to put a where clause
on your delete statement and delete every row in the
table!).

What Is MySQL?
Relational databases have been available commercially
for over two decades. Some of the most mature and
popular commercial products include:
Oracle Database from Oracle Corporation
SQL Server from Microsoft
DB2 Universal Database from IBM
Sybase Adaptive Server from Sybase
All these database servers do approximately the same
thing, although some are better equipped to run very
large or very-high-throughput databases. Others are
better at handling objects or very large files or XML
documents, and so on. Additionally, all these servers do a
pretty good job of complying with the latest ANSI SQL
standard. This is a good thing, and I make it a point to
show you how to write SQL statements that will run on
any of these platforms with little or no modification.
Along with the commercial database servers, there has
been quite a bit of activity in the open source community
in the past five years with the goal of creating a viable
alternative to the commercial database servers. Two of
the most commonly used open source database servers
are PostgreSQL and MySQL. The MySQL website
(http://www.mysql.com) currently claims over 10 million
installations, its server is available for free, and I have
found its server to be extremely simple to download and
install. For these reasons, I have decided that all
examples for this book be run against a MySQL (version
6.0) database, and that the mysql command-line tool be
used to format query results. Even if you are already
using another server and never plan to use MySQL, I
urge you to install the latest MySQL server, load the
sample schema and data, and experiment with the data
and examples in this book.
However, keep in mind the following caveat:
This is not a book about MySQL’s SQL implementation.
Rather, this book is designed to teach you how to craft
SQL statements that will run on MySQL with no

modifications, and will run on recent releases of Oracle
Database, Sybase Adaptive Server, and SQL Server with
few or no modifications.
To keep the code in this book as vendor-independent as
possible, I will refrain from demonstrating some of the
interesting things that the MySQL SQL language
implementers have decided to do that can’t be done on
other database implementations. Instead, Appendix B
covers some of these features for readers who are
planning to continue using MySQL.

What’s in Store
The overall goal of the next four chapters is to introduce the
SQL data statements, with a special emphasis on the three
main clauses of the select statement. Additionally, you will
see many examples that use the bank schema (introduced in
the next chapter), which will be used for all examples in the
book. It is my hope that familiarity with a single database will
allow you to get to the crux of an example without your having
to stop and examine the tables being used each time. If it
becomes a bit tedious working with the same set of tables,
feel free to augment the sample database with additional
tables, or invent your own database with which to experiment.
After you have a solid grasp on the basics, the remaining
chapters will drill deep into additional concepts, most of
which are independent of each other. Thus, if you find yourself
getting confused, you can always move ahead and come back
later to revisit a chapter. When you have finished the book
and worked through all of the examples, you will be well on
your way to becoming a seasoned SQL practitioner.

databases, the history of computerized database systems, or
the SQL language than was covered in this short introduction,

Chapter 2. Creating and Populating a
Database
This chapter provides you with the information you need
to create your first database and to create the tables and
associated data used for the examples in this book. You
will also learn about various data types and see how to
create tables using them. Because the examples in this
book are executed against a MySQL database, this
chapter is somewhat skewed toward MySQL’s features
and syntax, but most concepts are applicable to any
server.
Creating a MySQL Database
If you already have a MySQL database server available
for your use, you can skip the installation instructions
and start with the instructions in Table 2-1. Keep in mind,
however, that this book assumes that you are using
MySQL version 6.0 or later, so you may want to consider
upgrading your server or installing another server if you
are using an earlier release.
The following instructions show you the minimum steps
required to install a MySQL 6.0 server on a Windows
computer:
1. Go to the download page for the MySQL Database
Server at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads. If you are
loading version 6.0, the full URL is
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/6.0.html.
2. Download the Windows Essentials (x86) package,
which includes only the commonly used tools.
3. When asked “Do you want to run or save this file?”
click Run.
4. The MySQL Server 6.0—Setup Wizard window
appears. Click Next.
5. Activate the Typical Install radio button, and click
Next.
6. Click Install.
7. A MySQL Enterprise window appears. Click Next
twice.

8. When the installation is complete, make sure the box
is checked next to “Configure the MySQL Server
now,” and then click Finish. This launches the
Configuration Wizard.
9. When the Configuration Wizard launches, activate
the Standard Configuration radio button, and then
select both the “Install as Windows Service” and
“Include Bin Directory in Windows Path” checkboxes.
Click Next.
10. Select the Modify Security Settings checkbox and
enter a password for the root user (make sure you
write down the password, because you will need it
shortly!), and click Next.
11. Click Execute.
At this point, if all went well, the MySQL server is
installed and running. If not, I suggest you uninstall the
server and read the “Troubleshooting a MySQL
Installation Under Windows” guide (which you can find
at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/windows-
troubleshooting.html).
Warning ☠
If you uninstalled an older version of MySQL before
loading version 6.0, you may have some further
cleanup to do (I had to clean out some old Registry
entries) before you can get the Configuration Wizard
to run successfully.
Next, you will need to open a Windows command
window, launch the mysql tool, and create your database
and database user. Table 2-1 describes the necessary
steps. In step 5, feel free to choose your own password
for the lrngsql user rather than “xyz” (but don’t forget
to write it down!).
Table 2-1. Creating the sample database
Step Description Action
1 Open the Run dialog box from the Choose Start and then Run
Start menu
2 Launch a command window Type cmd and click OK
3 Log in to MySQL as root mysql -u root -p

Step Description Action
4 Create a database for the sample create database bank;

5 Create the lrngsql database user grant all privileges on bank.* to

'xyz';
database
6 Exit the mysql tool quit;
7 Log in to MySQL as lrngsql mysql -u lrngsql -p;
8 Attach to the bank database use bank;
You now have a MySQL server, a database, and a
database user; the only thing left to do is create the
database tables and populate them with sample data. To
do so, download the script at
http://examples.oreilly.com/learningsql/ and run it from
the mysql utility. If you saved the file as
c:\temp\LearningSQLExample.sql, you would need to do
the following:
1. If you have logged out of the mysql tool, repeat steps
7 and 8 from Table 2-1.
2. Type source c:\temp\LearningSQLExample.sql;
and press Enter.
You should now have a working database populated with
all the data needed for the examples in this book.

Using the mysql Command-Line Tool
Whenever you invoke the mysql command-line tool, you
can specify the username and database to use, as in the
following:
mysql -u lrngsql -p bank
This will save you from having to type use bank; every
time you start up the tool. You will be asked for your
password, and then the mysql> prompt will appear, via
which you will be able to issue SQL statements and view
the results. For example, if you want to know the current
date and time, you could issue the following query:
mysql> SELECT now();
+---------------------+
| now() |
+---------------------+
| 2008-02-19 16:48:46 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
The now() function is a built-in MySQL function that
returns the current date and time. As you can see, the
mysql command-line tool formats the results of your
queries within a rectangle bounded by +, -, and |
characters. After the results have been exhausted (in this
case, there is only a single row of results), the mysql
command-line tool shows how many rows were returned
and how long the SQL statement took to execute.
About Missing from Clauses
With some database servers, you won’t be able to issue
a query without a from clause that names at least one
table. Oracle Database is a commonly used server for
which this is true. For cases when you only need to call
a function, Oracle provides a table called dual, which
consists of a single column called dummy that contains a
single row of data. In order to be compatible with
Oracle Database, MySQL also provides a dual table.
The previous query to determine the current date and
time could therefore be written as:
mysql> SELECT now()
FROM dual;
+---------------------+
| now() |

+---------------------+
| 2005-05-06 16:48:46 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
If you are not using Oracle and have no need to be
compatible with Oracle, you can ignore the dual table
altogether and use just a select clause without a from
clause.
When you are done with the mysql command-line tool,
simply type quit; or exit; to return to the Windows
command shell.

MySQL Data Types
In general, all the popular database servers have the
capacity to store the same types of data, such as strings,
dates, and numbers. Where they typically differ is in the
specialty data types, such as XML documents or very
large text or binary documents. Since this is an
introductory book on SQL, and since 98% of the columns
you encounter will be simple data types, this book covers
only the character, date, and numeric data types.
Character Data
Character data can be stored as either fixed-length or
variable-length strings; the difference is that fixed-length
strings are right-padded with spaces and always
consume the same number of bytes, and variable-length
strings are not right-padded with spaces and don’t
always consume the same number of bytes. When
defining a character column, you must specify the
maximum size of any string to be stored in the column.
For example, if you want to store strings up to 20
characters in length, you could use either of the
following definitions:
char(20) /* fixed-length */
varchar(20) /* variable-length */
The maximum length for char columns is currently 255
bytes, whereas varchar columns can be up to 65,535
bytes. If you need to store longer strings (such as emails,
XML documents, etc.), then you will want to use one of
the text types (mediumtext and longtext), which I cover
later in this section. In general, you should use the char
type when all strings to be stored in the column are of
the same length, such as state abbreviations, and the
varchar type when strings to be stored in the column are
of varying lengths. Both char and varchar are used in a
similar fashion in all the major database servers.

Note ✎
Oracle Database is an exception when it comes to the
use of varchar. Oracle users should use the
varchar2 type when defining variable-length
character columns.
Character sets
For languages that use the Latin alphabet, such as
English, there is a sufficiently small number of
characters such that only a single byte is needed to store
each character. Other languages, such as Japanese and
Korean, contain large numbers of characters, thus
requiring multiple bytes of storage for each character.
Such character sets are therefore called multibyte
character sets.
MySQL can store data using various character sets, both
single- and multibyte. To view the supported character
sets in your server, you can use the show command, as in:
mysql> SHOW CHARACTER SET;

-+--------+
36 rows in set (0.11 sec)
If the value in the fourth column, maxlen, is greater than
1, then the character set is a multibyte character set.
When I installed the MySQL server, the latin1 character
set was automatically chosen as the default character
set. However, you may choose to use a different
character set for each character column in your
database, and you can even store different character sets
within the same table. To choose a character set other
than the default when defining a column, simply name
one of the supported character sets after the type
definition, as in:
varchar(20) character set utf8
With MySQL, you may also set the default character set
for your entire database:
create database foreign_sales character set utf8;
While this is as much information regarding character
sets as I’m willing to discuss in an introductory book,
there is a great deal more to the topic of
internationalization than what is shown here. If you plan
to deal with multiple or unfamiliar character sets, you
may want to pick up a book such as Andy Deitsch and
David Czarnecki’s Java Internationalization (O’Reilly) or
Richard Gillam’s Unicode Demystified: A Practical
Programmer’s Guide to the Encoding Standard (Addison-
Wesley).
Text data
If you need to store data that might exceed the 64 KB
limit for varchar columns, you will need to use one of the
text types.
Table 2-2 shows the available text types and their
maximum sizes.
Table 2-2. MySQL text types
Text type Maximum number of bytes
Tinytext 255
Text 65,535
Mediumtext 16,777,215

Text type Maximum number of bytes
Longtext 4,294,967,295
When choosing to use one of the text types, you should
be aware of the following:
If the data being loaded into a text column exceeds
the maximum size for that type, the data will be
truncated.
Trailing spaces will not be removed when data is
loaded into the column.
When using text columns for sorting or grouping,
only the first 1,024 bytes are used, although this limit
may be increased if necessary.
The different text types are unique to MySQL. SQL
Server has a single text type for large character
data, whereas DB2 and Oracle use a data type called
clob, for Character Large Object.
Now that MySQL allows up to 65,535 bytes for
varchar columns (it was limited to 255 bytes in
version 4), there isn’t any particular need to use the
tinytext or text type.
If you are creating a column for free-form data entry,
such as a notes column to hold data about customer
interactions with your company’s customer service
department, then varchar will probably be adequate. If
you are storing documents, however, you should choose
either the mediumtext or longtext type.
Note ✎
Oracle Database allows up to 2,000 bytes for char
columns and 4,000 bytes for varchar2 columns. SQL
Server can handle up to 8,000 bytes for both char
and varchar data.
Numeric Data
Although it might seem reasonable to have a single
numeric data type called “numeric,” there are actually
several different numeric data types that reflect the
various ways in which numbers are used, as illustrated
here:

A column indicating whether a customer order has been
shipped
This type of column, referred to as a Boolean, would
contain a 0 to indicate false and a 1 to indicate true.
A system-generated primary key for a transaction table
This data would generally start at 1 and increase in
increments of one up to a potentially very large
number.
An item number for a customer’s electronic shopping
basket
The values for this type of column would be positive
whole numbers between 1 and, at most, 200 (for
shopaholics).
Positional data for a circuit board drill machine
High-precision scientific or manufacturing data often
requires accuracy to eight decimal points.
To handle these types of data (and more), MySQL has
several different numeric data types. The most commonly
used numeric types are those used to store whole
numbers. When specifying one of these types, you may
also specify that the data is unsigned, which tells the
server that all data stored in the column will be greater
than or equal to zero. Table 2-3 shows the five different
data types used to store whole-number integers.
Table 2-3. MySQL integer types
Type Signed range Unsigned range
Tinyint −128 to 127 0 to 255
Smallint −32,768 to 32,767 0 to 65,535
Mediumint −8,388,608 to 8,388,607 0 to 16,777,215
Int −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 0 to 4,294,967,295
Bigint −9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 0 to
9,223,372,036,854,775,807 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
When you create a column using one of the integer types,
MySQL will allocate an appropriate amount of space to
store the data, which ranges from one byte for a tinyint
to eight bytes for a bigint. Therefore, you should try to
choose a type that will be large enough to hold the

biggest number you can envision being stored in the
column without needlessly wasting storage space.
For floating-point numbers (such as 3.1415927), you may
choose from the numeric types shown in Table 2-4.
Table 2-4. MySQL floating-point types
Type Numeric range
Float( p , s ) −3.402823466E+38 to −1.175494351E-38
and 1.175494351E-38 to 3.402823466E+38
Double( p , s −1.7976931348623157E+308 to −2.2250738585072014E-
) 308
and 2.2250738585072014E-308 to
1.7976931348623157E+308
When using a floating-point type, you can specify a
precision (the total number of allowable digits both to
the left and to the right of the decimal point) and a scale
(the number of allowable digits to the right of the
decimal point), but they are not required. These values
are represented in Table 2-4 as p and s. If you specify a
precision and scale for your floating-point column,
remember that the data stored in the column will be
rounded if the number of digits exceeds the scale and/or
precision of the column. For example, a column defined
as float(4,2) will store a total of four digits, two to the
left of the decimal and two to the right of the decimal.
Therefore, such a column would handle the numbers
27.44 and 8.19 just fine, but the number 17.8675 would
be rounded to 17.87, and attempting to store the number
178.375 in your float(4,2) column would generate an
error.
Like the integer types, floating-point columns can be
defined as unsigned, but this designation only prevents
negative numbers from being stored in the column rather
than altering the range of data that may be stored in the
column.
Temporal Data
Along with strings and numbers, you will almost certainly
be working with information about dates and/or times.
This type of data is referred to as temporal, and some
examples of temporal data in a database include:

The future date that a particular event is expected to
happen, such as shipping a customer’s order
The date that a customer’s order was shipped
The date and time that a user modified a particular
row in a table
An employee’s birth date
The year corresponding to a row in a yearly_sales
fact table in a data warehouse
The elapsed time needed to complete a wiring
harness on an automobile assembly line
MySQL includes data types to handle all of these
situations. Table 2-5 shows the temporal data types
supported by MySQL.
Table 2-5. MySQL temporal types
Type Default format Allowable values
Date YYYY-MM-DD 1000-01-01 to 9999-12-31
Datetime YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS 1000-01-01 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59
Timestamp YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS 1970-01-01 00:00:00 to 2037-12-31 23:59:59
Year YYYY 1901 to 2155
Time HHH:MI:SS −838:59:59 to 838:59:59
While database servers store temporal data in various
ways, the purpose of a format string (second column of
Table 2-5) is to show how the data will be represented
when retrieved, along with how a date string should be
constructed when inserting or updating a temporal
column. Thus, if you wanted to insert the date March 23,
2005 into a date column using the default format YYYY-
MM-DD, you would use the string '2005-03-23'.
Chapter 7 fully explores how temporal data is
constructed and displayed.

Note ✎
Each database server allows a different range of
dates for temporal columns. Oracle Database accepts
dates ranging from 4712 BC to 9999 AD, while SQL
Server only handles dates ranging from 1753 AD to
9999 AD (unless you are using SQL Server 2008’s
new datetime2 data type, which allows for dates
ranging from 1 AD to 9999 AD). MySQL falls in
between Oracle and SQL Server and can store dates
from 1000 AD to 9999 AD. Although this might not
make any difference for most systems that track
current and future events, it is important to keep in
mind if you are storing historical dates.
Table 2-6 describes the various components of the date
formats shown in Table 2-5.
Table 2-6. Date format components
| Component | Definition              | Range                         |

Here’s how the various temporal types would be used to
implement the examples shown earlier:
Columns to hold the expected future shipping date of
a customer order and an employee’s birth date would
use the date type, since it is unnecessary to know at
what time a person was born and unrealistic to
schedule a future shipment down to the second.
A column to hold information about when a customer
order was actually shipped would use the datetime
type, since it is important to track not only the date
that the shipment occurred but the time as well.
A column that tracks when a user last modified a
particular row in a table would use the timestamp
type. The timestamp type holds the same information

as the datetime type (year, month, day, hour, minute,
second), but a timestamp column will automatically
be populated with the current date/time by the
MySQL server when a row is added to a table or
when a row is later modified.
A column holding just year data would use the year
type.
Columns that hold data regarding the length of time
needed to complete a task would use the time type.
For this type of data, it would be unnecessary and
confusing to store a date component, since you are
interested only in the number of
hours/minutes/seconds needed to complete the task.
This information could be derived using two
datetime columns (one for the task start date/time
and the other for the task completion date/time) and
subtracting one from the other, but it is simpler to
use a single time column.
Chapter 7 explores how to work with each of these
temporal data types.

Table Creation
Now that you have a firm grasp on what data types may
be stored in a MySQL database, it’s time to see how to
use these types in table definitions. Let’s start by
defining a table to hold information about a person.
Step 1: Design
A good way to start designing a table is to do a bit of
brainstorming to see what kind of information would be
helpful to include. Here’s what I came up with after
thinking for a short time about the types of information
that describe a person:
Name
Gender
Birth date
Address
Favorite foods
This is certainly not an exhaustive list, but it’s good
enough for now. The next step is to assign column names
and data types. Table 2-7 shows my initial attempt.
Table 2-7. Person table, first pass
Column Type Allowable values
Name Varchar(40)
Gender Char(1) M, F
Birth_date Date
Address Varchar(100)
Favorite_foods Varchar(200)
The name, address, and favorite_foods columns are of
type varchar and allow for free-form data entry. The
gender column allows a single character which should
equal only M or F. The birth_date column is of type
date, since a time component is not needed.
Step 2: Refinement
In Chapter 1, you were introduced to the concept of
normalization, which is the process of ensuring that
there are no duplicate (other than foreign keys) or
compound columns in your database design. In looking at

the columns in the person table a second time, the
following issues arise:
The name column is actually a compound object
consisting of a first name and a last name.
Since multiple people can have the same name,
gender, birth date, and so forth, there are no columns
in the person table that guarantee uniqueness.
The address column is also a compound object
consisting of street, city, state/province, country, and
postal code.
The favorite_foods column is a list containing 0, 1,
or more independent items. It would be best to
create a separate table for this data that includes a
foreign key to the person table so that you know to
which person a particular food may be attributed.
After taking these issues into consideration, Table 2-8
gives a normalized version of the person table.
Table 2-8. Person table, second pass
| Column      | Type                | Allowable values |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Person_id   | Smallint (unsigned) |                  |
| First_name  | Varchar(20)         |                  |
| Last_name   | Varchar(20)         |                  |
| Gender      | Char(1)             | M, F             |
| Birth_date  | Date                |                  |
| Street      | Varchar(30)         |                  |
| City        | Varchar(20)         |                  |
| State       | Varchar(20)         |                  |
| Country     | Varchar(20)         |                  |
| Postal_code | Varchar(20)         |                  |
Now that the person table has a primary key (person_id)
to guarantee uniqueness, the next step is to build a
favorite_food table that includes a foreign key to the
person table. Table 2-9 shows the result.
Table 2-9. Favorite_food table
| Column    | Type                |     |
| --------- | ------------------- | --- |
| Person_id | Smallint (unsigned) |     |
| Food      | Varchar(20)         |     |

The person_id and food columns comprise the primary
key of the favorite_food table, and the person_id
column is also a foreign key to the person table.
How Much Is Enough?
Moving the favorite_foods column out of the person
table was definitely a good idea, but are we done yet?
What happens, for example, if one person lists “pasta”
as a favorite food while another person lists
“spaghetti”? Are they the same thing? In order to
prevent this problem, you might decide that you want
people to choose their favorite foods from a list of
options, in which case you should create a food table
with food_id and food_name columns, and then change
the favorite_food table to contain a foreign key to the
food table. While this design would be fully
normalized, you might decide that you simply want to
store the values that the user has entered, in which
case you may leave the table as is.
Step 3: Building SQL Schema Statements
Now that the design is complete for the two tables
holding information about people and their favorite
foods, the next step is to generate SQL statements to
create the tables in the database. Here is the statement
to create the person table:
CREATE TABLE person
(person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
fname VARCHAR(20),
lname VARCHAR(20),
gender CHAR(1),
birth_date DATE,
street VARCHAR(30),
city VARCHAR(20),
state VARCHAR(20),
country VARCHAR(20),
postal_code VARCHAR(20),
CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY (person_id)
);
Everything in this statement should be fairly self-
explanatory except for the last item; when you define
your table, you need to tell the database server what
column or columns will serve as the primary key for the

table. You do this by creating a constraint on the table.
You can add several types of constraints to a table
definition. This constraint is a primary key constraint. It
is created on the person_id column and given the name
pk_person.
While on the topic of constraints, there is another type of
constraint that would be useful for the person table. In
Table 2-7, I added a third column to show the allowable
values for certain columns (such as 'M' and 'F' for the
gender column). Another type of constraint called a
check constraint constrains the allowable values for a
particular column. MySQL allows a check constraint to
be attached to a column definition, as in the following:
gender CHAR(1) CHECK (gender IN ('M','F')),
While check constraints operate as expected on most
database servers, the MySQL server allows check
constraints to be defined but does not enforce them.
However, MySQL does provide another character data
type called enum that merges the check constraint into
the data type definition. Here’s what it would look like
for the gender column definition:
gender ENUM('M','F'),
Here’s how the person table definition looks with an
enum data type for the gender column:
CREATE TABLE person
(person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
fname VARCHAR(20),
lname VARCHAR(20),
gender ENUM('M','F'),
birth_date DATE,
street VARCHAR(30),
city VARCHAR(20),
state VARCHAR(20),
country VARCHAR(20),
postal_code VARCHAR(20),
CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY (person_id)
);
Later in this chapter, you will see what happens if you try
to add data to a column that violates its check constraint
(or, in the case of MySQL, its enumeration values).
You are now ready to run the create table statement
using the mysql command-line tool. Here’s what it looks

like:
mysql> CREATE TABLE person
-> (person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
-> fname VARCHAR(20),
-> lname VARCHAR(20),
-> gender ENUM('M','F'),
-> birth_date DATE,
-> street VARCHAR(30),
-> city VARCHAR(20),
-> state VARCHAR(20),
-> country VARCHAR(20),
-> postal_code VARCHAR(20),
-> CONSTRAINT pk_person PRIMARY KEY (person_id)
-> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.27 sec)
After processing the create table statement, the
MySQL server returns the message “Query OK, 0 rows
affected,” which tells me that the statement had no
syntax errors. If you want to make sure that the person
table does, in fact, exist, you can use the describe
command (or desc for short) to look at the table
definition:
mysql> DESC person;
+-------------+----------------------+------+-----+---------+-
------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default |
Extra |
+-------------+----------------------+------+-----+---------+-
------+
| person_id | smallint(5) unsigned | | PRI | 0 |
|
| fname | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| lname | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| gender | enum('M','F') | YES | | NULL |
|
| birth_date | date | YES | | NULL |
|
| street | varchar(30) | YES | | NULL |
|
| city | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| state | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| country | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| postal_code | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|

+-------------+----------------------+------+-----+---------+-
------+
10 rows in set (0.06 sec)
Columns 1 and 2 of the describe output are self-
explanatory. Column 3 shows whether a particular
column can be omitted when data is inserted into the
table. I purposefully left this topic out of the discussion
for now (see the sidebar What Is Null? for a short
discourse), but we explore it fully in Chapter 4. The
fourth column shows whether a column takes part in any
keys (primary or foreign); in this case, the person_id
column is marked as the primary key. Column 5 shows
whether a particular column will be populated with a
default value if you omit the column when inserting data
into the table. The person_id column shows a default
value of 0, although this would work only once, since
each row in the person table must contain a unique value
for this column (since it is the primary key). The sixth
column (called “Extra”) shows any other pertinent
information that might apply to a column.
What Is Null?
In some cases, it is not possible or applicable to
provide a value for a particular column in your table.
For example, when adding data about a new customer
order, the ship_date column cannot yet be determined.
In this case, the column is said to be null (note that I do
not say that it equals null), which indicates the absence
of a value. Null is used for various cases where a value
cannot be supplied, such as:
Not applicable
Unknown
Empty set
When designing a table, you may specify which
columns are allowed to be null (the default), and which
columns are not allowed to be null (designated by
adding the keywords not null after the type
definition).
Now that you’ve created the person table, your next step
is to create the favorite_food table:

mysql> CREATE TABLE favorite_food
-> (person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED,
-> food VARCHAR(20),
-> CONSTRAINT pk_favorite_food PRIMARY KEY (person_id,
food),
-> CONSTRAINT fk_fav_food_person_id FOREIGN KEY
(person_id)
-> REFERENCES person (person_id)
-> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)
This should look very similar to the create table
statement for the person table, with the following
exceptions:
Since a person can have more than one favorite food
(which is the reason this table was created in the
first place), it takes more than just the person_id
column to guarantee uniqueness in the table. This
table, therefore, has a two-column primary key:
person_id and food.
The favorite_food table contains another type of
constraint called a foreign key constraint. This
constrains the values of the person_id column in the
favorite_food table to include only values found in
the person table. With this constraint in place, I will
not be able to add a row to the favorite_food table
indicating that person_id 27 likes pizza if there isn’t
already a row in the person table having a person_id
of 27.
Note ✎
If you forget to create the foreign key constraint
when you first create the table, you can add it later
via the alter table statement.
Describe shows the following after executing the create
table statement:
mysql> DESC favorite_food;
+--------------+----------------------+------+-----+---------
+-------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default |
Extra |
+--------------+----------------------+------+-----+---------
+-------+
| person_id | smallint(5) unsigned | | PRI | 0 |
|

| food | varchar(20) | | PRI | |
|
+--------------+----------------------+------+-----+---------
+-------+
Now that the tables are in place, the next logical step is
to add some data.

Populating and Modifying Tables
With the person and favorite_food tables in place, you
can now begin to explore the four SQL data statements:
insert, update, delete, and select.
Inserting Data
Since there is not yet any data in the person and
favorite_food tables, the first of the four SQL data
statements to be explored will be the insert statement.
There are three main components to an insert
statement:
The name of the table into which to add the data
The names of the columns in the table to be
populated
The values with which to populate the columns
You are not required to provide data for every column in
the table (unless all the columns in the table have been
defined as not null). In some cases, those columns that
are not included in the initial insert statement will be
given a value later via an update statement. In other
cases, a column may never receive a value for a
particular row of data (such as a customer order that is
canceled before being shipped, thus rendering the
ship_date column inapplicable).
Generating numeric key data
Before inserting data into the person table, it would be
useful to discuss how values are generated for numeric
primary keys. Other than picking a number out of thin
air, you have a couple of options:
Look at the largest value currently in the table and
add one.
Let the database server provide the value for you.
Although the first option may seem valid, it proves
problematic in a multiuser environment, since two users
might look at the table at the same time and generate the
same value for the primary key. Instead, all database
servers on the market today provide a safe, robust
method for generating numeric keys. In some servers,

such as the Oracle Database, a separate schema object is
used (called a sequence); in the case of MySQL, however,
you simply need to turn on the auto-increment feature for
your primary key column. Normally, you would do this at
table creation, but doing it now provides the opportunity
to learn another SQL schema statement, alter table,
which is used to modify the definition of an existing
table:
ALTER TABLE person MODIFY person_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED
AUTO_INCREMENT;
This statement essentially redefines the person_id
column in the person table. If you describe the table, you
will now see the auto-increment feature listed under the
“Extra” column for person_id:
mysql> DESC person;
+-------------+----------------------------+------+-----+-----
----+-----------------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key |
Default | Extra |
+-------------+----------------------------+------+-----+-----
----+-----------------+
| person_id | smallint(5) unsigned | | PRI | NULL
| auto_increment |
| . | | | |
| |
| . | | | |
| |
| . | | | |
| |
When you insert data into the person table, simply
provide a null value for the person_id column, and
MySQL will populate the column with the next available
number (by default, MySQL starts at 1 for auto-
increment columns).
The insert statement
Now that all the pieces are in place, it’s time to add some
data. The following statement creates a row in the
person table for William Turner:
mysql> INSERT INTO person
-> (person_id, fname, lname, gender, birth_date)
-> VALUES (null, 'William','Turner', 'M', '1972-05-27');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

The feedback (“Query OK, 1 row affected”) tells you that
your statement syntax was proper, and that one row was
added to the database (since it was an insert
statement). You can look at the data just added to the
table by issuing a select statement:
mysql> SELECT person_id, fname, lname, birth_date
-> FROM person;
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| person_id | fname | lname | birth_date |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| 1 | William | Turner | 1972-05-27 |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
As you can see, the MySQL server generated a value of 1
for the primary key. Since there is only a single row in
the person table, I neglected to specify which row I am
interested in and simply retrieved all the rows in the
table. If there were more than one row in the table,
however, I could add a where clause to specify that I
want to retrieve data only for the row having a value of 1
for the person_id column:
mysql> SELECT person_id, fname, lname, birth_date
-> FROM person
-> WHERE person_id = 1;
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| person_id | fname | lname | birth_date |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| 1 | William | Turner | 1972-05-27 |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
While this query specifies a particular primary key value,
you can use any column in the table to search for rows,
as shown by the following query, which finds all rows
with a value of 'Turner' for the lname column:
mysql> SELECT person_id, fname, lname, birth_date
-> FROM person
-> WHERE lname = 'Turner';
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| person_id | fname | lname | birth_date |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| 1 | William | Turner | 1972-05-27 |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Before moving on, a couple of things about the earlier
insert statement are worth mentioning:

Values were not provided for any of the address
columns. This is fine, since nulls are allowed for
those columns.
The value provided for the birth_date column was a
string. As long as you match the required format
shown in Table 2-5, MySQL will convert the string to
a date for you.
The column names and the values provided must
correspond in number and type. If you name seven
columns and provide only six values, or if you provide
values that cannot be converted to the appropriate
data type for the corresponding column, you will
receive an error.
William has also provided information about his favorite
three foods, so here are three insert statements to store
his food preferences:
mysql> INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
-> VALUES (1, 'pizza');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
-> VALUES (1, 'cookies');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
-> VALUES (1, 'nachos');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Here’s a query that retrieves William’s favorite foods in
alphabetical order using an order by clause:
mysql> SELECT food
-> FROM favorite_food
-> WHERE person_id = 1
-> ORDER BY food;
+---------+
| food |
+---------+
| cookies |
| nachos |
| pizza |
+---------+
3 rows in set (0.02 sec)
The order by clause tells the server how to sort the data
returned by the query. Without the order by clause,
there is no guarantee that the data in the table will be
retrieved in any particular order.

So that William doesn’t get lonely, you can execute
another insert statement to add Susan Smith to the
person table:
mysql> INSERT INTO person
-> (person_id, fname, lname, gender, birth_date,
-> street, city, state, country, postal_code)
-> VALUES (null, 'Susan','Smith', 'F', '1975-11-02',
-> '23 Maple St.', 'Arlington', 'VA', 'USA', '20220');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Since Susan was kind enough to provide her address, we
included five more columns than when William’s data
was inserted. If you query the table again, you will see
that Susan’s row has been assigned the value 2 for its
primary key value:
mysql> SELECT person_id, fname, lname, birth_date
-> FROM person;
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| person_id | fname | lname | birth_date |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
| 1 | William | Turner | 1972-05-27 |
| 2 | Susan | Smith | 1975-11-02 |
+-----------+---------+--------+------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Can I Get That in XML?
If you will be working with XML data, you will be happy
to know that most database servers provide a simple
way to generate XML output from a query. With
MySQL, for example, you can use the --xml option
when invoking the mysql tool, and all your output will
automatically be formatted using XML. Here’s what the
favorite-food data looks like as an XML document:
C:\database> mysql -u lrngsql -p --xml bank
Enter password: xxxxxx
Welcome to the MySQL Monitor...
Mysql> SELECT * FROM favorite_food;
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<resultset statement="select * from favorite_food"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
<row>
<field name="person_id">1</field>
<field name="food">cookies</field>
</row>
<row>
<field name="person_id">1</field>

<field name="food">nachos</field>
</row>
<row>
<field name="person_id">1</field>
<field name="food">pizza</field>
</row>
</resultset>
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
With SQL Server, you don’t need to configure your
command-line tool; you just need to add the for xml
clause to the end of your query, as in:
SELECT * FROM favorite_food
FOR XML AUTO, ELEMENTS
Updating Data
When the data for William Turner was initially added to
the table, data for the various address columns was
omitted from the insert statement. The next statement
shows how these columns can be populated via an
update statement:
mysql> UPDATE person
-> SET street = '1225 Tremont St.',
-> city = 'Boston',
-> state = 'MA',
-> country = 'USA',
-> postal_code = '02138'
-> WHERE person_id = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
The server responded with a two-line message: the
“Rows matched: 1” item tells you that the condition in
the where clause matched a single row in the table, and
the “Changed: 1” item tells you that a single row in the
table has been modified. Since the where clause specifies
the primary key of William’s row, this is exactly what you
would expect to have happen.
Depending on the conditions in your where clause, it is
also possible to modify more than one row using a single
statement. Consider, for example, what would happen if
your where clause looked as follows:
WHERE person_id < 10
Since both William and Susan have a person_id value
less than 10, both of their rows would be modified. If you

leave off the where clause altogether, your update
statement will modify every row in the table.
Deleting Data
It seems that William and Susan aren’t getting along very
well together, so one of them has got to go. Since William
was there first, Susan will get the boot courtesy of the
delete statement:
mysql> DELETE FROM person
-> WHERE person_id = 2;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Again, the primary key is being used to isolate the row of
interest, so a single row is deleted from the table. Similar
to the update statement, more than one row can be
deleted depending on the conditions in your where
clause, and all rows will be deleted if the where clause is
omitted.

When Good Statements Go Bad
So far, all of the SQL data statements shown in this
chapter have been well formed and have played by the
rules. Based on the table definitions for the person and
favorite_food tables, however, there are lots of ways
that you can run afoul when inserting or modifying data.
This section shows you some of the common mistakes
that you might come across and how the MySQL server
will respond.
Nonunique Primary Key
Because the table definitions include the creation of
primary key constraints, MySQL will make sure that
duplicate key values are not inserted into the tables. The
next statement attempts to bypass the auto-increment
feature of the person_id column and create another row
in the person table with a person_id of 1:
mysql> INSERT INTO person
-> (person_id, fname, lname, gender, birth_date)
-> VALUES (1, 'Charles','Fulton', 'M', '1968-01-15');
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'
There is nothing stopping you (with the current schema
objects, at least) from creating two rows with identical
names, addresses, birth dates, and so on, as long as they
have different values for the person_id column.
Nonexistent Foreign Key
The table definition for the favorite_food table includes
the creation of a foreign key constraint on the person_id
column. This constraint ensures that all values of
person_id entered into the favorite_food table exist in
the person table. Here’s what would happen if you tried
to create a row that violates this constraint:
mysql> INSERT INTO favorite_food (person_id, food)
-> VALUES (999, 'lasagna');
ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a
foreign key constraint
fails ('bank'.'favorite_food', CONSTRAINT
'fk_fav_food_person_id' FOREIGN KEY
('person_id') REFERENCES 'person' ('person_id'))
In this case, the favorite_food table is considered the
child and the person table is considered the parent, since

the favorite_food table is dependent on the person
table for some of its data. If you plan to enter data into
both tables, you will need to create a row in parent
before you can enter data into favorite_food.
Note ✎
Foreign key constraints are enforced only if your
tables are created using the InnoDB storage engine.
We discuss MySQL’s storage engines in Chapter 12.
Column Value Violations
The gender column in the person table is restricted to
the values 'M' for male and 'F' for female. If you
mistakenly attempt to set the value of the column to any
other value, you will receive the following response:
mysql> UPDATE person
-> SET gender = 'Z'
-> WHERE person_id = 1;
ERROR 1265 (01000): Data truncated for column 'gender' at row
1
The error message is a bit confusing, but it gives you the
general idea that the server is unhappy about the value
provided for the gender column.
Invalid Date Conversions
If you construct a string with which to populate a date
column, and that string does not match the expected
format, you will receive another error. Here’s an example
that uses a date format that does not match the default
date format of “YYYY-MM-DD”:
mysql> UPDATE person
-> SET birth_date = 'DEC-21-1980'
-> WHERE person_id = 1;
ERROR 1292 (22007): Incorrect date value: 'DEC-21-1980' for
column 'birth_date'
at row 1
In general, it is always a good idea to explicitly specify
the format string rather than relying on the default
format. Here’s another version of the statement that uses
the str_to_date function to specify which format string
to use:
mysql> UPDATE person
-> SET birth_date = str_to_date('DEC-21-1980' , '%b-%d-
%Y')

-> WHERE person_id = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.12 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
Not only is the database server happy, but William is
happy as well (we just made him eight years younger,
without the need for expensive cosmetic surgery!).
Note ✎
Earlier in the chapter, when I discussed the various
temporal data types, I showed date-formatting
strings such as “YYYY-MM-DD”. While many database
servers use this style of formatting, MySQL uses %Y
to indicate a four-character year. Here are a few
more formatters that you might need when
converting strings to datetimes in MySQL:
%a The short weekday name, such as Sun, Mon, ...
%b The short month name, such as Jan, Feb, ...
%c The numeric month (0..12)
%d The numeric day of the month (00..31)
%f The number of microseconds (000000..999999)
%H The hour of the day, in 24-hour format (00..23)
%h The hour of the day, in 12-hour format (01..12)
%i The minutes within the hour (00..59)
%j The day of year (001..366)
%M The full month name (January..December)
%m The numeric month
%p AM or PM
%s The number of seconds (00..59)
%W The full weekday name (Sunday..Saturday)
%w The numeric day of the week (0=Sunday..6=Saturday)
%Y The four-digit year

The Bank Schema
For the remainder of the book, you use a group of tables
that model a community bank. Some of the tables include
Employee, Branch, Account, Customer, Product, and
Transaction. The entire schema and example data
should have been created when you followed the final
steps at the beginning of the chapter for loading the
MySQL server and generating the sample data. To see a
diagram of the tables and their columns and
relationships, see Appendix A.
Table 2-10 shows all the tables used in the bank schema
along with short definitions.
Table 2-10. Bank schema definitions
Table name Definition
Account A particular product opened for a particular customer
Branch A location at which banking transactions are conducted
Business A corporate customer (subtype of the Customer table)
Customer A person or corporation known to the bank
Department A group of bank employees implementing a particular banking
function
Employee A person working for the bank
Individual A noncorporate customer (subtype of the Customer table)
Officer A person allowed to transact business for a corporate customer
Product A banking service offered to customers
Product_type A group of products having a similar function
Transaction A change made to an account balance
Feel free to experiment with the tables as much as you
want, including adding your own tables to expand the
bank’s business functions. You can always drop the
database and re-create it from the downloaded file if you
want to make sure your sample data is intact.
If you want to see the tables available in your database,
you can use the show tables command, as in:
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
+----------------+
| Tables_in_bank |
+----------------+
| account |
| branch |

| business |
| customer |
| department |
| employee |
| favorite_food |
| individual |
| officer |
| person |
| product |
| product_type |
| transaction |
+----------------+
13 rows in set (0.10 sec)
Along with the 11 tables in the bank schema, the table
listing also includes the two tables created in this
chapter: person and favorite_food. These tables will
not be used in later chapters, so feel free to drop them by
issuing the following commands:
mysql> DROP TABLE favorite_food;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.56 sec)
mysql> DROP TABLE person;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
If you want to look at the columns in a table, you can use
the describe command. Here’s an example of the
describe output for the customer table:
mysql> DESC customer;
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
------------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default |
Extra |
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
------------+
| cust_id | int(10) unsigned | NO | PRI | NULL |
auto_increment |
| fed_id | varchar(12) | NO | | NULL |
|
| cust_type_cd | enum('I','B') | NO | | NULL |
|
| address | varchar(30) | YES | | NULL |
|
| city | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| state | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| postal_code | varchar(10) | YES | | NULL |
|
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
------------+
7 rows in set (0.03 sec)

The more comfortable you are with the example
database, the better you will understand the examples
and, consequently, the concepts in the following
chapters.

Chapter 3. Query Primer
So far, you have seen a few examples of database queries
(a.k.a. select statements) sprinkled throughout the first
two chapters. Now it’s time to take a closer look at the
different parts of the select statement and how they
interact.
Query Mechanics
Before dissecting the select statement, it might be
interesting to look at how queries are executed by the
MySQL server (or, for that matter, any database server).
If you are using the mysql command-line tool (which I
assume you are), then you have already logged in to the
MySQL server by providing your username and password
(and possibly a hostname if the MySQL server is running
on a different computer). Once the server has verified
that your username and password are correct, a
database connection is generated for you to use. This
connection is held by the application that requested it
(which, in this case, is the mysql tool) until the
application releases the connection (i.e., as a result of
your typing quit) or the server closes the connection
(i.e., when the server is shut down). Each connection to
the MySQL server is assigned an identifier, which is
shown to you when you first log in:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 11
Server version: 6.0.3-alpha-community MySQL Community Server
(GPL)
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
In this case, my connection ID is 11. This information
might be useful to your database administrator if
something goes awry, such as a malformed query that
runs for hours, so you might want to jot it down.
Once the server has verified your username and
password and issued you a connection, you are ready to
execute queries (along with other SQL statements). Each
time a query is sent to the server, the server checks the
following things prior to statement execution:

Do you have permission to execute the statement?
Do you have permission to access the desired data?
Is your statement syntax correct?
If your statement passes these three tests, then your
query is handed to the query optimizer, whose job it is to
determine the most efficient way to execute your query.
The optimizer will look at such things as the order in
which to join the tables named in your from clause and
what indexes are available, and then picks an execution
plan, which the server uses to execute your query.
Note ✎
Understanding and influencing how your database
server chooses execution plans is a fascinating topic
that many of you will wish to explore. For those
readers using MySQL, you might consider reading
Baron Schwartz et al.’s High Performance MySQL
(O’Reilly). Among other things, you will learn how to
generate indexes, analyze execution plans, influence
the optimizer via query hints, and tune your server’s
startup parameters. If you are using Oracle Database
or SQL Server, dozens of tuning books are available.
Once the server has finished executing your query, the
result set is returned to the calling application (which is,
once again, the mysql tool). As I mentioned in Chapter 1,
a result set is just another table containing rows and
columns. If your query fails to yield any results, the
mysql tool will show you the message found at the end of
the following example:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE lname = 'Bkadfl';
Empty set(0.00 sec)
If the query returns one or more rows, the mysql tool will
format the results by adding column headers and by
constructing boxes around the columns using the -, |, and
+ symbols, as shown in the next example:
mysql> SELECT fname, lname
-> FROM employee;
+----------+-----------+
| fname | lname |

+----------+-----------+
| Michael | Smith |
| Susan | Barker |
| Robert | Tyler |
| Susan | Hawthorne |
| John | Gooding |
| Helen | Fleming |
| Chris | Tucker |
| Sarah | Parker |
| Jane | Grossman |
| Paula | Roberts |
| Thomas | Ziegler |
| Samantha | Jameson |
| John | Blake |
| Cindy | Mason |
| Frank | Portman |
| Theresa | Markham |
| Beth | Fowler |
| Rick | Tulman |
+----------+-----------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query returns the first and last names of all the
employees in the employee table. After the last row of
data is displayed, the mysql tool displays a message
telling you how many rows were returned, which, in this
case, is 18.

Query Clauses
Several components or clauses make up the select
statement. While only one of them is mandatory when
using MySQL (the select clause), you will usually
include at least two or three of the six available clauses.
Table 3-1 shows the different clauses and their purposes.
Table 3-1. Query clauses
Clause
Purpose
name
Select Determines which columns to include in the query’s result set
From Identifies the tables from which to draw data and how the tables
should be joined
Where Filters out unwanted data
Group by Used to group rows together by common column values
Having Filters out unwanted groups
Order by Sorts the rows of the final result set by one or more columns
All of the clauses shown in Table 3-1 are included in the
ANSI specification; additionally, several other clauses are
unique to MySQL that we explore in Appendix B. The
following sections delve into the uses of the six major
query clauses.

The select Clause
Even though the select clause is the first clause of a
select statement, it is one of the last clauses that the
database server evaluates. The reason for this is that
before you can determine what to include in the final
result set, you need to know all of the possible columns
that could be included in the final result set. In order to
fully understand the role of the select clause, therefore,
you will need to understand a bit about the from clause.
Here’s a query to get started:
mysql> SELECT *
-> FROM department;
+---------+----------------+
| dept_id | name |
+---------+----------------+
| 1 | Operations |
| 2 | Loans |
| 3 | Administration |
+---------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.04 sec)
In this query, the from clause lists a single table
(department), and the select clause indicates that all
columns (designated by *) in the department table
should be included in the result set. This query could be
described in English as follows:
Show me all the columns and all the rows in the
department table.
In addition to specifying all the columns via the asterisk
character, you can explicitly name the columns you are
interested in, such as:
mysql> SELECT dept_id, name
-> FROM department;
+---------+----------------+
| dept_id | name |
+---------+----------------+
| 1 | Operations |
| 2 | Loans |
| 3 | Administration |
+---------+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The results are identical to the first query, since all the
columns in the department table (dept_id and name) are
named in the select clause. You can choose to include

only a subset of the columns in the department table as
well:
mysql> SELECT name
-> FROM department;
+----------------+
| name |
+----------------+
| Operations |
| Loans |
| Administration |
+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The job of the select clause, therefore, is the following:
The select clause determines which of all possible
columns should be included in the query’s result set.
If you were limited to including only columns from the
table or tables named in the from clause, things would be
rather dull. However, you can spice things up by
including in your select clause such things as:
Literals, such as numbers or strings
Expressions, such as transaction.amount * −1
Built-in function calls, such as
ROUND(transaction.amount, 2)
User-defined function calls
The next query demonstrates the use of a table column, a
literal, an expression, and a built-in function call in a
single query against the employee table:
mysql> SELECT emp_id,
-> 'ACTIVE',
-> emp_id * 3.14159,
-> UPPER(lname)
-> FROM employee;
+--------+--------+------------------+--------------+
| emp_id | ACTIVE | emp_id * 3.14159 | UPPER(lname) |
+--------+--------+------------------+--------------+
| 1 | ACTIVE | 3.14159 | SMITH |
| 2 | ACTIVE | 6.28318 | BARKER |
| 3 | ACTIVE | 9.42477 | TYLER |
| 4 | ACTIVE | 12.56636 | HAWTHORNE |
| 5 | ACTIVE | 15.70795 | GOODING |
| 6 | ACTIVE | 18.84954 | FLEMING |
| 7 | ACTIVE | 21.99113 | TUCKER |
| 8 | ACTIVE | 25.13272 | PARKER |
| 9 | ACTIVE | 28.27431 | GROSSMAN |
| 10 | ACTIVE | 31.41590 | ROBERTS |
| 11 | ACTIVE | 34.55749 | ZIEGLER |

| 12 | ACTIVE | 37.69908 | JAMESON |
| 13 | ACTIVE | 40.84067 | BLAKE |
| 14 | ACTIVE | 43.98226 | MASON |
| 15 | ACTIVE | 47.12385 | PORTMAN |
| 16 | ACTIVE | 50.26544 | MARKHAM |
| 17 | ACTIVE | 53.40703 | FOWLER |
| 18 | ACTIVE | 56.54862 | TULMAN |
+--------+--------+------------------+--------------+
18 rows in set (0.05 sec)
We cover expressions and built-in functions in detail
later, but I wanted to give you a feel for what kinds of
things can be included in the select clause. If you only
need to execute a built-in function or evaluate a simple
expression, you can skip the from clause entirely. Here’s
an example:
mysql> SELECT VERSION(),
-> USER(),
-> DATABASE();
+-----------------------+-------------------+------------+
| version() | user() | database() |
+-----------------------+-------------------+------------+
| 6.0.3-alpha-community | lrngsql@localhost | bank |
+-----------------------+-------------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
Since this query simply calls three built-in functions and
doesn’t retrieve data from any tables, there is no need
for a from clause.
Column Aliases
Although the mysql tool will generate labels for the
columns returned by your queries, you may want to
assign your own labels. While you might want to assign a
new label to a column from a table (if it is poorly or
ambiguously named), you will almost certainly want to
assign your own labels to those columns in your result
set that are generated by expressions or built-in function
calls. You can do so by adding a column alias after each
element of your select clause. Here’s the previous query
against the employee table with column aliases applied
to three of the columns:
mysql> SELECT emp_id,
-> 'ACTIVE' status,
-> emp_id * 3.14159 empid_x_pi,
-> UPPER(lname) last_name_upper
-> FROM employee;

+--------+--------+------------+-----------------+
| emp_id | status | empid_x_pi | last_name_upper |
+--------+--------+------------+-----------------+
| 1 | ACTIVE | 3.14159 | SMITH |
| 2 | ACTIVE | 6.28318 | BARKER |
| 3 | ACTIVE | 9.42477 | TYLER |
| 4 | ACTIVE | 12.56636 | HAWTHORNE |
| 5 | ACTIVE | 15.70795 | GOODING |
| 6 | ACTIVE | 18.84954 | FLEMING |
| 7 | ACTIVE | 21.99113 | TUCKER |
| 8 | ACTIVE | 25.13272 | PARKER |
| 9 | ACTIVE | 28.27431 | GROSSMAN |
| 10 | ACTIVE | 31.41590 | ROBERTS |
| 11 | ACTIVE | 34.55749 | ZIEGLER |
| 12 | ACTIVE | 37.69908 | JAMESON |
| 13 | ACTIVE | 40.84067 | BLAKE |
| 14 | ACTIVE | 43.98226 | MASON |
| 15 | ACTIVE | 47.12385 | PORTMAN |
| 16 | ACTIVE | 50.26544 | MARKHAM |
| 17 | ACTIVE | 53.40703 | FOWLER |
| 18 | ACTIVE | 56.54862 | TULMAN |
+--------+--------+------------+-----------------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
If you look at the column headers, you can see that the
second, third, and fourth columns now have reasonable
names instead of simply being labeled with the function
or expression that generated the column. If you look at
the select clause, you can see how the column aliases
status, empid_x_pi, and last_name_upper are added
after the second, third, and fourth columns. I think you
will agree that the output is easier to understand with
column aliases in place, and it would be easier to work
with programmatically if you were issuing the query from
within Java or C# rather than interactively via the mysql
tool. In order to make your column aliases stand out even
more, you also have the option of using the as keyword
before the alias name, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id,
-> 'ACTIVE' AS status,
-> emp_id * 3.14159 AS empid_x_pi,
-> UPPER(lname) AS last_name_upper
-> FROM employee;
Many people feel that including the optional as keyword
improves readability, although I have chosen not to use it
for the examples in this book.

Removing Duplicates
In some cases, a query might return duplicate rows of
data. For example, if you were to retrieve the IDs of all
customers that have accounts, you would see the
following:
mysql> SELECT cust_id
-> FROM account;
+---------+
| cust_id |
+---------+
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |
| 6 |
| 7 |
| 8 |
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 9 |
| 9 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
| 13 |
+---------+
24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Since some customers have more than one account, you
will see the same customer ID once for each account
owned by that customer. What you probably want in this
case is the distinct set of customers that have accounts,
instead of seeing the customer ID for each row in the
account table. You can achieve this by adding the
keyword distinct directly after the select keyword, as
demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT cust_id
-> FROM account;

+---------+
| cust_id |
+---------+
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |
| 7 |
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
| 13 |
+---------+
13 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The result set now contains 13 rows, one for each
distinct customer, rather than 24 rows, one for each
account.
If you do not want the server to remove duplicate data,
or you are sure there will be no duplicates in your result
set, you can specify the ALL keyword instead of
specifying DISTINCT. However, the ALL keyword is the
default and never needs to be explicitly named, so most
programmers do not include ALL in their queries.
Warning ☠
Keep in mind that generating a distinct set of results
requires the data to be sorted, which can be time-
consuming for large result sets. Don’t fall into the
trap of using DISTINCT just to be sure there are no
duplicates; instead, take the time to understand the
data you are working with so that you will know
whether duplicates are possible.

The from Clause
Thus far, you have seen queries whose from clauses
contain a single table. Although most SQL books will
define the from clause as simply a list of one or more
tables, I would like to broaden the definition as follows:
The from clause defines the tables used by a query, along
with the means of linking the tables together.
This definition is composed of two separate but related
concepts, which we explore in the following sections.
Tables
When confronted with the term table, most people think
of a set of related rows stored in a database. While this
does describe one type of table, I would like to use the
word in a more general way by removing any notion of
how the data might be stored and concentrating on just
the set of related rows. Three different types of tables
meet this relaxed definition:
Permanent tables (i.e., created using the create
table statement)
Temporary tables (i.e., rows returned by a subquery)
Virtual tables (i.e., created using the create view
statement)
Each of these table types may be included in a query’s
from clause. By now, you should be comfortable with
including a permanent table in a from clause, so I briefly
describe the other types of tables that can be referenced
in a from clause.
Subquery-generated tables
A subquery is a query contained within another query.
Subqueries are surrounded by parentheses and can be
found in various parts of a select statement; within the
from clause, however, a subquery serves the role of
generating a temporary table that is visible from all other
query clauses and can interact with other tables named
in the from clause. Here’s a simple example:
mysql> SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname
-> FROM (SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
-> FROM employee) e;

+--------+----------+-----------+
| emp_id | fname | lname |
+--------+----------+-----------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith |
| 2 | Susan | Barker |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne |
| 5 | John | Gooding |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming |
| 7 | Chris | Tucker |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler |
| 12 | Samantha | Jameson |
| 13 | John | Blake |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason |
| 15 | Frank | Portman |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman |
+--------+----------+-----------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
In this example, a subquery against the employee table
returns five columns, and the containing query
references three of the five available columns. The
subquery is referenced by the containing query via its
alias, which, in this case, is e. This is a simplistic and not
particularly useful example of a subquery in a from
clause; you will find detailed coverage of subqueries in
Chapter 9.
Views
A view is a query that is stored in the data dictionary. It
looks and acts like a table, but there is no data
associated with a view (this is why I call it a virtual
table). When you issue a query against a view, your query
is merged with the view definition to create a final query
to be executed.
To demonstrate, here’s a view definition that queries the
employee table and includes a call to a built-in function:
mysql> CREATE VIEW employee_vw AS
-> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname,
-> YEAR(start_date) start_year
-> FROM employee;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)

When the view is created, no additional data is generated
or stored: the server simply tucks away the select
statement for future use. Now that the view exists, you
can issue queries against it, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, start_year
-> FROM employee_vw;
+--------+------------+
| emp_id | start_year |
+--------+------------+
| 1 | 2005 |
| 2 | 2006 |
| 3 | 2005 |
| 4 | 2006 |
| 5 | 2007 |
| 6 | 2008 |
| 7 | 2008 |
| 8 | 2006 |
| 9 | 2006 |
| 10 | 2006 |
| 11 | 2004 |
| 12 | 2007 |
| 13 | 2004 |
| 14 | 2006 |
| 15 | 2007 |
| 16 | 2005 |
| 17 | 2006 |
| 18 | 2006 |
+--------+------------+
18 rows in set (0.07 sec)
Views are created for various reasons, including to hide
columns from users and to simplify complex database
designs.
Table Links
The second deviation from the simple from clause
definition is the mandate that if more than one table
appears in the from clause, the conditions used to link
the tables must be included as well. This is not a
requirement of MySQL or any other database server, but
it is the ANSI-approved method of joining multiple tables,
and it is the most portable across the various database
servers. We explore joining multiple tables in depth in
Chapters 5 and 10, but here’s a simple example in case I
have piqued your curiosity:
mysql> SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.fname,
-> employee.lname, department.name dept_name

-> FROM employee INNER JOIN department
-> ON employee.dept_id = department.dept_id;
+--------+----------+-----------+----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | dept_name |
+--------+----------+-----------+----------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | Administration |
| 2 | Susan | Barker | Administration |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | Administration |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | Operations |
| 5 | John | Gooding | Loans |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | Operations |
| 7 | Chris | Tucker | Operations |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | Operations |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | Operations |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | Operations |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler | Operations |
| 12 | Samantha | Jameson | Operations |
| 13 | John | Blake | Operations |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | Operations |
| 15 | Frank | Portman | Operations |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | Operations |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | Operations |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | Operations |
+--------+----------+-----------+----------------+
18 rows in set (0.05 sec)
The previous query displays data from both the employee
table (emp_id, fname, lname) and the department table
(name), so both tables are included in the from clause.
The mechanism for linking the two tables (referred to as
a join) is the employee’s department affiliation stored in
the employee table. Thus, the database server is
instructed to use the value of the dept_id column in the
employee table to look up the associated department
name in the department table. Join conditions for two
tables are found in the on subclause of the from clause;
in this case, the join condition is ON employee.dept_id =
department.dept_id. Again, please refer to Chapter 5
for a thorough discussion of joining multiple tables.
Defining Table Aliases
When multiple tables are joined in a single query, you
need a way to identify which table you are referring to
when you reference columns in the select, where, group
by, having, and order by clauses. You have two choices
when referencing a table outside the from clause:

Use the entire table name, such as employee.emp_id.
Assign each table an alias and use the alias
throughout the query.
In the previous query, I chose to use the entire table
name in the select and on clauses. Here’s what the
same query looks like using table aliases:
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname,
d.name dept_name
FROM employee e INNER JOIN department d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
If you look closely at the from clause, you will see that
the employee table is assigned the alias e, and the
department table is assigned the alias d. These aliases
are then used in the on clause when defining the join
condition as well as in the select clause when specifying
the columns to include in the result set. I hope you will
agree that using aliases makes for a more compact
statement without causing confusion (as long as your
choices for alias names are reasonable). Additionally, you
may use the as keyword with your table aliases, similar
to what was demonstrated earlier for column aliases:
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname,
d.name dept_name
FROM employee AS e INNER JOIN department AS d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
I have found that roughly half of the database developers
I have worked with use the as keyword with their column
and table aliases, and half do not.

The where Clause
The queries shown thus far in the chapter have selected
every row from the employee, department, or account
table (except for the demonstration of distinct earlier
in the chapter). Most of the time, however, you will not
wish to retrieve every row from a table but will want a
way to filter out those rows that are not of interest. This
is a job for the where clause.
The where clause is the mechanism for filtering out
unwanted rows from your result set.
For example, perhaps you are interested in retrieving
data from the employee table, but only for those
employees who are employed as head tellers. The
following query employs a where clause to retrieve only
the four head tellers:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Head Teller';
+--------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date | title |
+--------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | 2008-03-17 | Head Teller |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 2006-07-27 | Head Teller |
| 13 | John | Blake | 2004-05-11 | Head Teller |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 2005-03-15 | Head Teller |
+--------+---------+---------+------------+-------------+
4 rows in set (1.17 sec)
In this case the where clause filtered out 14 of the 18
employee rows. This where clause contains a single filter
condition, but you can include as many conditions as
required; individual conditions are separated using
operators such as and, or, and not (see Chapter 4 for a
complete discussion of the where clause and filter
conditions). Here’s an extension of the previous query
that includes a second condition stating that only those
employees with a start date later than January 1, 2006
should be included:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Head Teller'
-> AND start_date > '2006-01-01';
+--------+-------+---------+------------+-------------+

| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date | title |
+--------+-------+---------+------------+-------------+
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | 2008-03-17 | Head Teller |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 2006-07-27 | Head Teller |
+--------+-------+---------+------------+-------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The first condition (title = 'Head Teller') filtered out
14 of 18 employee rows, and the second condition
(start_date > '2006-01-01') filtered out an additional
2 rows, leaving 2 rows in the final result set. Let’s see
what would happen if you change the operator
separating the two conditions from and to or:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Head Teller'
-> OR start_date > '2006-01-01';
+--------+----------+-----------+------------+----------------
----+
| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date | title
|

15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Looking at the output, you can see that all four head
tellers are included in the result set, along with any other
employee who started working for the bank after January
1, 2006. At least one of the two conditions is true for 15
of the 18 employees in the employee table. Thus, when
you separate conditions using the and operator, all
conditions must evaluate to true to be included in the
result set; when you use or, however, only one of the
conditions needs to evaluate to true for a row to be
included.
So, what should you do if you need to use both and and
or operators in your where clause? Glad you asked. You
should use parentheses to group conditions together. The
next query specifies that only those employees who are
head tellers and began working for the company after
January 1, 2006 or those employees who are tellers and
began working after January 1, 2007 be included in the
result set:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE (title = 'Head Teller' AND start_date > '2006-01-
01')
-> OR (title = 'Teller' AND start_date > '2007-01-01');
+--------+----------+---------+------------+-------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date | title |

| 15 | Frank | Portman | 2007-04-01 | Teller |
+--------+----------+---------+------------+-------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
You should always use parentheses to separate groups of
conditions when mixing different operators so that you,
the database server, and anyone who comes along later
to modify your code will be on the same page.

The group by and having Clauses
All the queries thus far have retrieved raw data without
any manipulation. Sometimes, however, you will want to
find trends in your data that will require the database
server to cook the data a bit before you retrieve your
result set. One such mechanism is the group by clause,
which is used to group data by column values. For
example, rather than looking at a list of employees and
the departments to which they are assigned, you might
want to look at a list of departments along with the
number of employees assigned to each department.
When using the group by clause, you may also use the
having clause, which allows you to filter group data in
the same way the where clause lets you filter raw data.
Here’s a quick look at a query that counts all the
employees in each department and returns the names of
those departments having more than two employees:
mysql> SELECT d.name, count(e.emp_id) num_employees
-> FROM department d INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
-> GROUP BY d.name
-> HAVING count(e.emp_id) > 2;
+----------------+---------------+
| name | num_employees |
+----------------+---------------+
| Administration | 3 |
| Operations | 14 |
+----------------+---------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
I wanted to briefly mention these two clauses so that
they don’t catch you by surprise later in the book, but
they are a bit more advanced than the other four select
clauses. Therefore, I ask that you wait until Chapter 8 for
a full description of how and when to use group by and
having.

The order by Clause
In general, the rows in a result set returned from a query
are not in any particular order. If you want your result
set in a particular order, you will need to instruct the
server to sort the results using the order by clause:
The order by clause is the mechanism for sorting your
result set using either raw column data or expressions
based on column data.
For example, here’s another look at an earlier query
against the account table:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, product_cd
-> FROM account;
+-------------+------------+
| open_emp_id | product_cd |
+-------------+------------+
| 10 | CHK |
| 10 | SAV |
| 10 | CD |
| 10 | CHK |
| 10 | SAV |
| 13 | CHK |
| 13 | MM |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | SAV |
| 1 | MM |
| 16 | CHK |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | CD |
| 10 | CD |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | SAV |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | MM |
| 1 | CD |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | BUS |
| 10 | BUS |
| 16 | CHK |
| 13 | SBL |
+-------------+------------+
24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
If you are trying to analyze data for each employee, it
would be helpful to sort the results by the open_emp_id
column; to do so, simply add this column to the order by
clause:

mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, product_cd
-> FROM account
-> ORDER BY open_emp_id;
+-------------+------------+
| open_emp_id | product_cd |
+-------------+------------+
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | SAV |
| 1 | MM |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | CD |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | MM |
| 1 | CD |
| 10 | CHK |
| 10 | SAV |
| 10 | CD |
| 10 | CHK |
| 10 | SAV |
| 10 | CD |
| 10 | BUS |
| 13 | CHK |
| 13 | MM |
| 13 | SBL |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | SAV |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | BUS |
| 16 | CHK |
+-------------+------------+
24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
It is now easier to see what types of accounts each
employee opened. However, it might be even better if
you could ensure that the account types were shown in
the same order for each distinct employee; you can
accomplish this by adding the product_cd column after
the open_emp_id column in the order by clause:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, product_cd
-> FROM account
-> ORDER BY open_emp_id, product_cd;
+-------------+------------+
| open_emp_id | product_cd |
+-------------+------------+
| 1 | CD |
| 1 | CD |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | CHK |
| 1 | CHK |

| 1 | MM |
| 1 | MM |
| 1 | SAV |
| 10 | BUS |
| 10 | CD |
| 10 | CD |
| 10 | CHK |
| 10 | CHK |
| 10 | SAV |
| 10 | SAV |
| 13 | CHK |
| 13 | MM |
| 13 | SBL |
| 16 | BUS |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | CHK |
| 16 | SAV |
+-------------+------------+
24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The result set has now been sorted first by employee ID
and then by account type. The order in which columns
appear in your order by clause does make a difference.
Ascending Versus Descending Sort Order
When sorting, you have the option of specifying
ascending or descending order via the asc and desc
keywords. The default is ascending, so you will need to
add the desc keyword, only if you want to use a
descending sort. For example, the following query lists
all accounts sorted by available balance with the highest
balance listed at the top:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, open_date, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> ORDER BY avail_balance DESC;
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | open_date | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
| 29 | SBL | 2004-02-22 | 50000.00 |
| 28 | CHK | 2003-07-30 | 38552.05 |
| 24 | CHK | 2002-09-30 | 23575.12 |
| 15 | CD | 2004-12-28 | 10000.00 |
| 27 | BUS | 2004-03-22 | 9345.55 |
| 22 | MM | 2004-10-28 | 9345.55 |
| 12 | MM | 2004-09-30 | 5487.09 |
| 17 | CD | 2004-01-12 | 5000.00 |
| 18 | CHK | 2001-05-23 | 3487.19 |

| 3 | CD | 2004-06-30 | 3000.00 |
| 4 | CHK | 2001-03-12 | 2258.02 |
| 13 | CHK | 2004-01-27 | 2237.97 |
| 8 | MM | 2002-12-15 | 2212.50 |
| 23 | CD | 2004-06-30 | 1500.00 |
| 1 | CHK | 2000-01-15 | 1057.75 |
| 7 | CHK | 2002-11-23 | 1057.75 |
| 11 | SAV | 2000-01-15 | 767.77 |
| 10 | CHK | 2003-09-12 | 534.12 |
| 2 | SAV | 2000-01-15 | 500.00 |

| 25 | BUS | 2002-10-01 | 0.00 |
+------------+------------+------------+---------------+
24 rows in set (0.05 sec)
Descending sorts are commonly used for ranking
queries, such as “show me the top five account
balances.” MySQL includes a limit clause that allows
you to sort your data and then discard all but the first X
rows; see Appendix B for a discussion of the limit
clause, along with other non-ANSI extensions.
Sorting via Expressions
Sorting your results using column data is all well and
good, but sometimes you might need to sort by
something that is not stored in the database, and
possibly doesn’t appear anywhere in your query. You can
add an expression to your order by clause to handle
such situations. For example, perhaps you would like to
sort your customer data by the last three digits of the
customer’s federal ID number (which is either a Social
Security number for individuals or a corporate ID for
businesses):
mysql> SELECT cust_id, cust_type_cd, city, state, fed_id
-> FROM customer
-> ORDER BY RIGHT(fed_id, 3);
+---------+--------------+------------+-------+-------------+
| cust_id | cust_type_cd | city | state | fed_id |
+---------+--------------+------------+-------+-------------+
| 1 | I | Lynnfield | MA | 111-11-1111 |
| 10 | B | Salem | NH | 04-1111111 |
| 2 | I | Woburn | MA | 222-22-2222 |
| 11 | B | Wilmington | MA | 04-2222222 |
| 3 | I | Quincy | MA | 333-33-3333 |

| 12 | B | Salem | NH | 04-3333333 |
| 13 | B | Quincy | MA | 04-4444444 |
| 4 | I | Waltham | MA | 444-44-4444 |
| 5 | I | Salem | NH | 555-55-5555 |
| 6 | I | Waltham | MA | 666-66-6666 |
| 7 | I | Wilmington | MA | 777-77-7777 |
| 8 | I | Salem | NH | 888-88-8888 |
| 9 | I | Newton | MA | 999-99-9999 |
+---------+--------------+------------+-------+-------------+
13 rows in set (0.24 sec)
This query uses the built-in function right() to extract
the last three characters of the fed_id column and then
sorts the rows based on this value.
Sorting via Numeric Placeholders
If you are sorting using the columns in your select
clause, you can opt to reference the columns by their
position in the select clause rather than by name. For
example, if you want to sort using the second and fifth
columns returned by a query, you could do the following:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, title, start_date, fname, lname
-> FROM employee
-> ORDER BY 2, 5;
+--------+--------------------+------------+----------+-------
----+
| emp_id | title | start_date | fname | lname
|
+--------+--------------------+------------+----------+-------

You might want to use this feature sparingly, since
adding a column to the select clause without changing
the numbers in the order by clause can lead to
unexpected results. Personally, I may reference columns
positionally when writing ad hoc queries, but I always
reference columns by name when writing code.

Test Your Knowledge
The following exercises are designed to strengthen your
understanding of the select statement and its various
clauses. Please see Appendix C for solutions.
Exercise 3-1
Retrieve the employee ID, first name, and last name for
all bank employees. Sort by last name and then by first
name.
Exercise 3-2
Retrieve the account ID, customer ID, and available
balance for all accounts whose status equals 'ACTIVE'
and whose available balance is greater than $2,500.
Exercise 3-3
Write a query against the account table that returns the
IDs of the employees who opened the accounts (use the
account.open_emp_id column). Include a single row for
each distinct employee.
Exercise 3-4
Fill in the blanks (denoted by <#>) for this multi-data-set
query to achieve the results shown here:

Chapter 4. Filtering
Sometimes you will want to work with every row in a
table, such as:
Purging all data from a table used to stage new data
warehouse feeds
Modifying all rows in a table after a new column has
been added
Retrieving all rows from a message queue table
In cases like these, your SQL statements won’t need to
have a where clause, since you don’t need to exclude any
rows from consideration. Most of the time, however, you
will want to narrow your focus to a subset of a table’s
rows. Therefore, all the SQL data statements (except the
insert statement) include an optional where clause to
house filter conditions used to restrict the number of
rows acted on by the SQL statement. Additionally, the
select statement includes a having clause in which filter
conditions pertaining to grouped data may be included.
This chapter explores the various types of filter
conditions that you can employ in the where clauses of
select, update, and delete statements; we explore the
use of filter conditions in the having clause of a select
statement in Chapter 8.
Condition Evaluation
A where clause may contain one or more conditions,
separated by the operators and and or. If multiple
conditions are separated only by the and operator, then
all the conditions must evaluate to true for the row to be
included in the result set. Consider the following where
clause:
WHERE title = 'Teller' AND start_date < '2007-01-01'
Given these two conditions, only tellers who began
working for the bank prior to 2007 will be included (or, to
look at it another way, any employee who is either not a
teller or began working for the bank in 2007 or later will
be removed from consideration). Although this example
uses only two conditions, no matter how many conditions
are in your where clause, if they are separated by the and

operator they must all evaluate to true for the row to be
included in the result set.
If all conditions in the where clause are separated by the
or operator, however, only one of the conditions must
evaluate to true for the row to be included in the result
set. Consider the following two conditions:
WHERE title = 'Teller' OR start_date < '2007-01-01'
There are now various ways for a given employee row to
be included in the result set:
The employee is a teller and was employed prior to
2007.
The employee is a teller and was employed after
January 1, 2007.
The employee is something other than a teller but
was employed prior to 2007.
Table 4-1 shows the possible outcomes for a where clause
containing two conditions separated by the or operator.
Table 4-1. Two-condition evaluation using or
Intermediate result Final result
WHERE true OR true True
WHERE true OR false True
WHERE false OR true True
WHERE false OR false False
In the case of the preceding example, the only way for a
row to be excluded from the result set is if the employee
is not a teller and was employed on or after January 1,
2007.
Using Parentheses
If your where clause includes three or more conditions
using both the and and or operators, you should use
parentheses to make your intent clear, both to the
database server and to anyone else reading your code.
Here’s a where clause that extends the previous example
by checking to make sure that the employee is still
employed by the bank:
WHERE end_date IS NULL
AND (title = 'Teller' OR start_date < '2007-01-01')
There are now three conditions; for a row to make it to
the final result set, the first condition must evaluate to

true, and either the second or third condition (or both)
must evaluate to true. Table 4-2 shows the possible
outcomes for this where clause.
Table 4-2. Three-condition evaluation using and, or
Intermediate result Final result
WHERE true AND (true OR true) True
WHERE true AND (true OR false) True
WHERE true AND (false OR true) True
WHERE true AND (false OR false) False
WHERE false AND (true OR true) False
WHERE false AND (true OR false) False
WHERE false AND (false OR true) False
WHERE false AND (false OR false) False
As you can see, the more conditions you have in your
where clause, the more combinations there are for the
server to evaluate. In this case, only three of the eight
combinations yield a final result of true.
Using the not Operator
Hopefully, the previous three-condition example is fairly
easy to understand. Consider the following modification,
however:
WHERE end_date IS NULL
AND NOT (title = 'Teller' OR start_date < '2007-01-01')
Did you spot the change from the previous example? I
added the not operator after the and operator on the
second line. Now, instead of looking for nonterminated
employees who either are tellers or began working for
the bank prior to 2007, I am looking for nonterminated
employees who both are nontellers and began working
for the bank in 2007 or later. Table 4-3 shows the
possible outcomes for this example.

While it is easy for the database server to handle, it is
typically difficult for a person to evaluate a where clause
that includes the not operator, which is why you won’t
encounter it very often. In this case, you can rewrite the
where clause to avoid using the not operator:
WHERE end_date IS NULL
AND title != 'Teller' AND start_date >= '2007-01-01'
While I’m sure that the server doesn’t have a preference,
you probably have an easier time understanding this
version of the where clause.

Building a Condition
Now that you have seen how the server evaluates
multiple conditions, let’s take a step back and look at
what comprises a single condition. A condition is made
up of one or more expressions coupled with one or more
operators. An expression can be any of the following:
A number
A column in a table or view
A string literal, such as 'Teller'
A built-in function, such as concat('Learning', '
', 'SQL')
A subquery
A list of expressions, such as ('Teller', 'Head
Teller', 'Operations Manager')
The operators used within conditions include:
Comparison operators, such as =, !=, <, >, <>, LIKE,
IN, and BETWEEN
Arithmetic operators, such as +, −, *, and /
The following section demonstrates how you can combine
these expressions and operators to manufacture the
various types of conditions.

Condition Types
There are many different ways to filter out unwanted
data. You can look for specific values, sets of values, or
ranges of values to include or exclude, or you can use
various pattern-searching techniques to look for partial
matches when dealing with string data. The next four
subsections explore each of these condition types in
detail.
Equality Conditions
A large percentage of the filter conditions that you write
or come across will be of the form 'column =
expression' as in:
title = 'Teller'
fed_id = '111-11-1111'
amount = 375.25
dept_id = (SELECT dept_id FROM department WHERE name =
'Loans')
Conditions such as these are called equality conditions
because they equate one expression to another. The first
three examples equate a column to a literal (two strings
and a number), and the fourth example equates a column
to the value returned from a subquery. The following
query uses two equality conditions; one in the on clause
(a join condition), and the other in the where clause (a
filter condition):
mysql> SELECT pt.name product_type, p.name product
-> FROM product p INNER JOIN product_type pt
-> ON p.product_type_cd = pt.product_type_cd
-> WHERE pt.name = 'Customer Accounts';
+-------------------+------------------------+
| product_type | product |
+-------------------+------------------------+
| Customer Accounts | certificate of deposit |
| Customer Accounts | checking account |
| Customer Accounts | money market account |
| Customer Accounts | savings account |
+-------------------+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.08 sec)
This query shows all products that are customer account
types.
Inequality conditions

Another fairly common type of condition is the inequality
condition, which asserts that two expressions are not
equal. Here’s the previous query with the filter condition
in the where clause changed to an inequality condition:
mysql> SELECT pt.name product_type, p.name product
-> FROM product p INNER JOIN product_type pt
-> ON p.product_type_cd = pt.product_type_cd
-> WHERE pt.name <> 'Customer Accounts';
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
| product_type | product |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Individual and Business Loans | auto loan |
| Individual and Business Loans | business line of credit |
| Individual and Business Loans | home mortgage |
| Individual and Business Loans | small business loan |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query shows all products that are not customer
account types. When building inequality conditions, you
may choose to use either the != or <> operator.
Data modification using equality conditions
Equality/inequality conditions are commonly used when
modifying data. For example, let’s say that the bank has
a policy of removing old account rows once per year.
Your task is to remove rows from the account table that
were closed in 2002. Here’s one way to tackle it:
DELETE FROM account
WHERE status = 'CLOSED' AND YEAR(close_date) = 2002;
This statement includes two equality conditions: one to
find only closed accounts, and another to check for those
accounts closed in 2002.

Note ✎
When crafting examples of delete and update
statements, I try to write each statement such that no
rows are modified. That way, when you execute the
statements, your data will remain unchanged, and
your output from select statements will always
match that shown in this book.
Since MySQL sessions are in auto-commit mode by
default (see Chapter 12), you would not be able to
roll back (undo) any changes made to the example
data if one of my statements modified the data. You
may, of course, do whatever you want with the
example data, including wiping it clean and
rerunning the scripts I have provided, but I try to
leave it intact.
Range Conditions
Along with checking that an expression is equal to (or not
equal to) another expression, you can build conditions
that check whether an expression falls within a certain
range. This type of condition is common when working
with numeric or temporal data. Consider the following
query:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE start_date < '2007-01-01';
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date |
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | 2005-06-22 |
| 2 | Susan | Barker | 2006-09-12 |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | 2005-02-09 |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | 2006-04-24 |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | 2006-12-02 |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | 2006-05-03 |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 2006-07-27 |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler | 2004-10-23 |
| 13 | John | Blake | 2004-05-11 |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | 2006-08-09 |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 2005-03-15 |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | 2006-06-29 |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | 2006-12-12 |
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
13 rows in set (0.15 sec)

This query finds all employees hired prior to 2007. Along
with specifying an upper limit for the start date, you may
also want to specify a lower range for the start date:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE start_date < '2007-01-01'
-> AND start_date >= '2005-01-01';
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date |
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | 2005-06-22 |
| 2 | Susan | Barker | 2006-09-12 |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | 2005-02-09 |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | 2006-04-24 |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | 2006-12-02 |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | 2006-05-03 |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 2006-07-27 |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | 2006-08-09 |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 2005-03-15 |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | 2006-06-29 |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | 2006-12-12 |
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This version of the query retrieves all employees hired in
2005 or 2006.
The between operator
When you have both an upper and lower limit for your
range, you may choose to use a single condition that
utilizes the between operator rather than using two
separate conditions, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2005-01-01' AND '2007-01-01';
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | start_date |
+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | 2005-06-22 |
| 2 | Susan | Barker | 2006-09-12 |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | 2005-02-09 |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | 2006-04-24 |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | 2006-12-02 |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | 2006-05-03 |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 2006-07-27 |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | 2006-08-09 |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 2005-03-15 |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | 2006-06-29 |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | 2006-12-12 |

+--------+---------+-----------+------------+
11 rows in set (0.03 sec)
When using the between operator, there are a couple of
things to keep in mind. You should always specify the
lower limit of the range first (after between) and the
upper limit of the range second (after and). Here’s what
happens if you mistakenly specify the upper limit first:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2005-01-01';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
As you can see, no data is returned. This is because the
server is, in effect, generating two conditions from your
single condition using the <= and >= operators, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE start_date >= '2007-01-01'
-> AND start_date <= '2005-01-01';
Empty set (0.00 sec)
Since it is impossible to have a date that is both greater
than January 1, 2007 and less than January 1, 2005, the
query returns an empty set. This brings me to the second
pitfall when using between, which is to remember that
your upper and lower limits are inclusive, meaning that
the values you provide are included in the range limits.
In this case, I want to specify 2005-01-01 as the lower
end of the range and 2006-12-31 as the upper end,
rather than 2007-01-01. Even though there probably
weren’t any employees who started working for the bank
on New Year’s Day 2007, it is best to specify exactly what
you want.
Along with dates, you can also build conditions to specify
ranges of numbers. Numeric ranges are fairly easy to
grasp, as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE avail_balance BETWEEN 3000 AND 5000;
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 3 | CD | 1 | 3000.00 |
| 17 | CD | 7 | 5000.00 |
| 18 | CHK | 8 | 3487.19 |

+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.10 sec)
All accounts with between $3,000 and $5,000 of an
available balance are returned. Again, make sure that
you specify the lower amount first.
String ranges
While ranges of dates and numbers are easy to
understand, you can also build conditions that search for
ranges of strings, which are a bit harder to visualize. Say,
for example, you are searching for customers having a
Social Security number that falls within a certain range.
The format for a Social Security number is “XXX-XX-
XXXX,” where X is a number from 0 to 9, and you want to
find every customer whose Social Security number lies
between “500-00-0000” and “999-99-9999.” Here’s what
the statement would look like:
mysql> SELECT cust_id, fed_id
-> FROM customer
-> WHERE cust_type_cd = 'I'
-> AND fed_id BETWEEN '500-00-0000' AND '999-99-9999';
+---------+-------------+
| cust_id | fed_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 5 | 555-55-5555 |
| 6 | 666-66-6666 |
| 7 | 777-77-7777 |
| 8 | 888-88-8888 |
| 9 | 999-99-9999 |
+---------+-------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
To work with string ranges, you need to know the order
of the characters within your character set (the order in
which the characters within a character set are sorted is
called a collation).
Membership Conditions
In some cases, you will not be restricting an expression
to a single value or range of values, but rather to a finite
set of values. For example, you might want to locate all
accounts whose product code is either 'CHK', 'SAV',
'CD', or 'MM':
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd = 'CHK' OR product_cd = 'SAV'

-> OR product_cd = 'CD' OR product_cd = 'MM';
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 1 | CHK | 1 | 1057.75 |
| 2 | SAV | 1 | 500.00 |
| 3 | CD | 1 | 3000.00 |
| 4 | CHK | 2 | 2258.02 |
| 5 | SAV | 2 | 200.00 |
| 7 | CHK | 3 | 1057.75 |
| 8 | MM | 3 | 2212.50 |
| 10 | CHK | 4 | 534.12 |
| 11 | SAV | 4 | 767.77 |
| 12 | MM | 4 | 5487.09 |
| 13 | CHK | 5 | 2237.97 |
| 14 | CHK | 6 | 122.37 |
| 15 | CD | 6 | 10000.00 |
| 17 | CD | 7 | 5000.00 |
| 18 | CHK | 8 | 3487.19 |
| 19 | SAV | 8 | 387.99 |
| 21 | CHK | 9 | 125.67 |
| 22 | MM | 9 | 9345.55 |
| 23 | CD | 9 | 1500.00 |
| 24 | CHK | 10 | 23575.12 |
| 28 | CHK | 12 | 38552.05 |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
21 rows in set (0.28 sec)
While this where clause (four conditions or‘d together)
wasn’t too tedious to generate, imagine if the set of
expressions contained 10 or 20 members. For these
situations, you can use the in operator instead:
SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
FROM account
WHERE product_cd IN ('CHK','SAV','CD','MM');
With the in operator, you can write a single condition no
matter how many expressions are in the set.
Using subqueries
Along with writing your own set of expressions, such as
('CHK','SAV','CD','MM'), you can use a subquery to
generate a set for you on the fly. For example, all four
product types used in the previous query have a
product_type_cd of 'ACCOUNT', so why not use a
subquery against the product table to retrieve the four
product codes instead of explicitly naming them:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account

-> WHERE product_cd IN (SELECT product_cd FROM product
-> WHERE product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT');
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 3 | CD | 1 | 3000.00 |
| 15 | CD | 6 | 10000.00 |
| 17 | CD | 7 | 5000.00 |
| 23 | CD | 9 | 1500.00 |
| 1 | CHK | 1 | 1057.75 |
| 4 | CHK | 2 | 2258.02 |
| 7 | CHK | 3 | 1057.75 |
| 10 | CHK | 4 | 534.12 |
| 13 | CHK | 5 | 2237.97 |
| 14 | CHK | 6 | 122.37 |
| 18 | CHK | 8 | 3487.19 |
| 21 | CHK | 9 | 125.67 |
| 24 | CHK | 10 | 23575.12 |
| 28 | CHK | 12 | 38552.05 |
| 8 | MM | 3 | 2212.50 |
| 12 | MM | 4 | 5487.09 |
| 22 | MM | 9 | 9345.55 |
| 2 | SAV | 1 | 500.00 |
| 5 | SAV | 2 | 200.00 |
| 11 | SAV | 4 | 767.77 |
| 19 | SAV | 8 | 387.99 |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
21 rows in set (0.11 sec)
The subquery returns a set of four values, and the main
query checks to see whether the value of the product_cd
column can be found in the set that the subquery
returned.
Using not in
Sometimes you want to see whether a particular
expression exists within a set of expressions, and
sometimes you want to see whether the expression does
not exist. For these situations, you can use the not in
operator:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd NOT IN ('CHK','SAV','CD','MM');
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 25 | BUS | 10 | 0.00 |
| 27 | BUS | 11 | 9345.55 |
| 29 | SBL | 13 | 50000.00 |

+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.09 sec)
This query finds all accounts that are not checking,
savings, certificate of deposit, or money market
accounts.
Matching Conditions
So far, you have been introduced to conditions that
identify an exact string, a range of strings, or a set of
strings; the final condition type deals with partial string
matches. You may, for example, want to find all
employees whose last name begins with T. You could use
a built-in function to strip off the first letter of the lname
column, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE LEFT(lname, 1) = 'T';
+--------+--------+--------+
| emp_id | fname | lname |
+--------+--------+--------+
| 3 | Robert | Tyler |
| 7 | Chris | Tucker |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman |
+--------+--------+--------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
While the built-in function left() does the job, it doesn’t
give you much flexibility. Instead, you can use wildcard
characters to build search expressions, as demonstrated
in the next section.
Using wildcards
When searching for partial string matches, you might be
interested in:
Strings beginning/ending with a certain character
Strings beginning/ending with a substring
Strings containing a certain character anywhere
within the string
Strings containing a substring anywhere within the
string
Strings with a specific format, regardless of
individual characters
You can build search expressions to identify these and
many other partial string matches by using the wildcard

characters shown in Table 4-4.
Table 4-4. Wildcard characters
Wildcard character Matches
_ Exactly one character
% Any number of characters (including 0)
The underscore character takes the place of a single
character, while the percent sign can take the place of a
variable number of characters. When building conditions
that utilize search expressions, you use the like
operator, as in:
mysql> SELECT lname
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE lname LIKE '_a%e%';
+-----------+
| lname |
+-----------+
| Barker |
| Hawthorne |
| Parker |
| Jameson |
+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The search expression in the previous example specifies
strings containing an a in the second position and
followed by an e at any other position in the string
(including the last position). Table 4-5 shows some more
search expressions and their interpretations.
Table 4-5. Sample search expressions
Search
Interpretation
expression
F% Strings beginning with F
%t Strings ending with t
%bas% Strings containing the substring 'bas'
_ _t_ Four-character strings with a t in the third position
_ _ _-_ _-_ _ _ 11-character strings with dashes in the fourth and seventh
_ positions
You could use the last example in Table 4-5 to find
customers whose federal ID matches the format used for
Social Security numbers, as in:
mysql> SELECT cust_id, fed_id
-> FROM customer
-> WHERE fed_id LIKE '___-__-____';

+---------+-------------+
| cust_id | fed_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 1 | 111-11-1111 |
| 2 | 222-22-2222 |
| 3 | 333-33-3333 |
| 4 | 444-44-4444 |
| 5 | 555-55-5555 |
| 6 | 666-66-6666 |
| 7 | 777-77-7777 |
| 8 | 888-88-8888 |
| 9 | 999-99-9999 |
+---------+-------------+
9 rows in set (0.02 sec)
The wildcard characters work fine for building simple
search expressions; if your needs are a bit more
sophisticated, however, you can use multiple search
expressions, as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE lname LIKE 'F%' OR lname LIKE 'G%';
+--------+-------+----------+
| emp_id | fname | lname |
+--------+-------+----------+
| 5 | John | Gooding |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler |
+--------+-------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query finds all employees whose last name begins
with F or G.
Using regular expressions
If you find that the wildcard characters don’t provide
enough flexibility, you can use regular expressions to
build search expressions. A regular expression is, in
essence, a search expression on steroids. If you are new
to SQL but have coded using programming languages
such as Perl, then you might already be intimately
familiar with regular expressions. If you have never used
regular expressions, then you may want to consult Jeffrey
E.F. Friedl’s Mastering Regular Expressions (O’Reilly),
since it is far too large a topic to try to cover in this book.
Here’s what the previous query (find all employees
whose last name starts with F or G) would look like using

the MySQL implementation of regular expressions:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE lname REGEXP '^[FG]';
+--------+-------+----------+
| emp_id | fname | lname |
+--------+-------+----------+
| 5 | John | Gooding |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler |
+--------+-------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The regexp operator takes a regular expression ('^[FG]'
in this example) and applies it to the expression on the
lefthand side of the condition (the column lname). The
query now contains a single condition using a regular
expression rather than two conditions using wildcard
characters.
Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server also support
regular expressions. With Oracle Database, you would
use the regexp_like function instead of the regexp
operator shown in the previous example, whereas SQL
Server allows regular expressions to be used with the
like operator.

Null: That Four-Letter Word
I put it off as long as I could, but it’s time to broach a
topic that tends to be met with fear, uncertainty, and
dread: the null value. Null is the absence of a value;
before an employee is terminated, for example, her
end_date column in the employee table should be null.
There is no value that can be assigned to the end_date
column that would make sense in this situation. Null is a
bit slippery, however, as there are various flavors of null:
Not applicable
Such as the employee ID column for a transaction that
took place at an ATM machine
Value not yet known
Such as when the federal ID is not known at the time
a customer row is created
Value undefined
Such as when an account is created for a product that
has not yet been added to the database
Note ✎
Some theorists argue that there should be a different
expression to cover each of these (and more)
situations, but most practitioners would agree that
having multiple null values would be far too
confusing.
When working with null, you should remember:
An expression can be null, but it can never equal
null.
Two nulls are never equal to each other.
To test whether an expression is null, you need to use
the is null operator, as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id IS NULL;
+--------+---------+-------+-----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | superior_emp_id |
+--------+---------+-------+-----------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | NULL |
+--------+---------+-------+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

This query returns all employees who do not have a boss
(wouldn’t that be nice?). Here’s the same query using =
null instead of is null:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id = NULL;
Empty set (0.01 sec)
As you can see, the query parses and executes but does
not return any rows. This is a common mistake made by
inexperienced SQL programmers, and the database
server will not alert you to your error, so be careful when
constructing conditions that test for null.
If you want to see whether a value has been assigned to
a column, you can use the is not null operator, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id IS NOT NULL;
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | superior_emp_id |
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| 2 | Susan | Barker | 1 |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | 1 |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | 3 |
| 5 | John | Gooding | 4 |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | 4 |
| 7 | Chris | Tucker | 6 |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | 6 |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | 6 |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 4 |

| 14 | Cindy | Mason | 13 |
| 15 | Frank | Portman | 13 |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 4 |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | 16 |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | 16 |
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
17 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This version of the query returns the other 17 employees
who, unlike Michael Smith, have a boss.
Before putting null aside for a while, it would be helpful
to investigate one more potential pitfall. Suppose that
you have been asked to identify all employees who are
not managed by Helen Fleming (whose employee ID is 6).
Your first instinct might be to do the following:

mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id != 6;
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | superior_emp_id |
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| 2 | Susan | Barker | 1 |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | 1 |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | 3 |
| 5 | John | Gooding | 4 |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | 4 |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 4 |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler | 10 |
| 12 | Samantha | Jameson | 10 |
| 13 | John | Blake | 4 |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | 13 |
| 15 | Frank | Portman | 13 |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 4 |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | 16 |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | 16 |
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
14 rows in set (0.00 sec)
While it is true that these 14 employees do not work for
Helen Fleming, if you look carefully at the data, you will
see that there is one more employee who doesn’t work
for Helen who is not listed here. That employee is
Michael Smith, and his superior_emp_id column is null
(because he’s the big cheese). To answer the question
correctly, therefore, you need to account for the
possibility that some rows might contain a null in the
superior_emp_id column:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id != 6 OR superior_emp_id IS NULL;
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | superior_emp_id |
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | NULL |
| 2 | Susan | Barker | 1 |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | 1 |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | 3 |
| 5 | John | Gooding | 4 |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | 4 |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | 4 |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler | 10 |
| 12 | Samantha | Jameson | 10 |
| 13 | John | Blake | 4 |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | 13 |

| 15 | Frank | Portman | 13 |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | 4 |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | 16 |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | 16 |
+--------+----------+-----------+-----------------+
15 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The result set now includes all 15 employees who don’t
work for Helen. When working with a database that you
are not familiar with, it is a good idea to find out which
columns in a table allow nulls so that you can take
appropriate measures with your filter conditions to keep
data from slipping through the cracks.

The following exercises test your understanding of filter
conditions. Please see Appendix C for solutions.
The following transaction data is used for the first two
exercises:

Chapter 5. Querying Multiple Tables
Back in Chapter 2, I demonstrated how related concepts
are broken into separate pieces through a process known
as normalization. The end result of this exercise was two
tables: person and favorite_food. If, however, you want
to generate a single report showing a person’s name,
address, and favorite foods, you will need a mechanism
to bring the data from these two tables back together
again; this mechanism is known as a join, and this
chapter concentrates on the simplest and most common
join, the inner join. Chapter 10 demonstrates all of the
different join types.
What Is a Join?
Queries against a single table are certainly not rare, but
you will find that most of your queries will require two,
three, or even more tables. To illustrate, let’s look at the
definitions for the employee and department tables and
then define a query that retrieves data from both tables:
mysql> DESC employee;
+--------------------+----------------------+------+-----+----
-----+
| Field | Type | Null | Key |
Default |
+--------------------+----------------------+------+-----+----
-----+
| emp_id | smallint(5) unsigned | NO | PRI |
NULL |
| fname | varchar(20) | NO | |
NULL |
| lname | varchar(20) | NO | |
NULL |
| start_date | date | NO | |
NULL |
| end_date | date | YES | |
NULL |
| superior_emp_id | smallint(5) unsigned | YES | MUL |
NULL |
| dept_id | smallint(5) unsigned | YES | MUL |
NULL |
| title | varchar(20) | YES | |
NULL |
| assigned_branch_id | smallint(5) unsigned | YES | MUL |
NULL |
+--------------------+----------------------+------+-----+----

-----+
9 rows in set (0.11 sec)
mysql> DESC department;
+---------+----------------------+------+-----+---------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default |
+---------+----------------------+------+-----+---------+
| dept_id | smallint(5) unsigned | No | PRI | NULL |
| name | varchar(20) | No | | NULL |
+---------+----------------------+------+-----+---------+
2 rows in set (0.03 sec)
Let’s say you want to retrieve the first and last names of
each employee along with the name of the department to
which each employee is assigned. Your query will
therefore need to retrieve the employee.fname,
employee.lname, and department.name columns. But
how can you retrieve data from both tables in the same
query? The answer lies in the employee.dept_id column,
which holds the ID of the department to which each
employee is assigned (in more formal terms, the
employee.dept_id column is the foreign key to the
department table). The query, which you will see shortly,
instructs the server to use the employee.dept_id column
as the bridge between the employee and department
tables, thereby allowing columns from both tables to be
included in the query’s result set. This type of operation
is known as a join.
Cartesian Product
The easiest way to start is to put the employee and
department tables into the from clause of a query and
see what happens. Here’s a query that retrieves the
employee’s first and last names along with the
department name, with a from clause naming both tables
separated by the join keyword:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname, d.name
-> FROM employee e JOIN department d;
+----------+-----------+----------------+
| fname | lname | name |
+----------+-----------+----------------+

+----------+-----------+----------------+
54 rows in set (0.23 sec)
Hmmm…there are only 18 employees and 3 different
departments, so how did the result set end up with 54
rows? Looking more closely, you can see that the set of
18 employees is repeated three times, with all the data
identical except for the department name. Because the
query didn’t specify how the two tables should be joined,
the database server generated the Cartesian product,
which is every permutation of the two tables (18
employees × 3 departments = 54 permutations). This
type of join is known as a cross join, and it is rarely used
(on purpose, at least). Cross joins are one of the join
types that we study in Chapter 10.
Inner Joins
To modify the previous query so that only 18 rows are
included in the result set (one for each employee), you
need to describe how the two tables are related. Earlier, I
showed that the employee.dept_id column serves as the
link between the two tables, so this information needs to
be added to the on subclause of the from clause:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname, d.name
-> FROM employee e JOIN department d
-> ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
+----------+-----------+----------------+
| fname | lname | name |
+----------+-----------+----------------+

| Theresa | Markham | Operations |
| Beth | Fowler | Operations |

| Rick | Tulman | Operations |
+----------+-----------+----------------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Instead of 54 rows, you now have the expected 18 rows
due to the addition of the on subclause, which instructs
the server to join the employee and department tables by
using the dept_id column to traverse from one table to
the other. For example, Susan Hawthorne’s row in the
employee table contains a value of 1 in the dept_id
column (not shown in the example). The server uses this
value to look up the row in the department table having a
value of 1 in its dept_id column and then retrieves the
value 'Operations' from the name column in that row.
If a value exists for the dept_id column in one table but
not the other, then the join fails for the rows containing
that value and those rows are excluded from the result
set. This type of join is known as an inner join, and it is
the most commonly used type of join. To clarify, if the
department table contains a fourth row for the marketing
department, but no employees have been assigned to
that department, then the marketing department would
not be included in the result set. Likewise, if some of the
employees had been assigned to department ID 99,
which doesn’t exist in the department table, then these
employees would be left out of the result set. If you want
to include all rows from one table or the other regardless
of whether a match exists, you need to specify an outer
join, but we cover this later in the book.
In the previous example, I did not specify in the from
clause which type of join to use. However, when you wish
to join two tables using an inner join, you should
explicitly specify this in your from clause; here’s the
same example, with the addition of the join type (note the
keyword INNER):
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname, d.name
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN department d
-> ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
+----------+-----------+----------------+
| fname | lname | name |
+----------+-----------+----------------+

| Frank | Portman | Operations |
| Theresa | Markham | Operations |
| Beth | Fowler | Operations |
| Rick | Tulman | Operations |
+----------+-----------+----------------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
If you do not specify the type of join, then the server will
do an inner join by default. As you will see later in the
book, however, there are several types of joins, so you
should get in the habit of specifying the exact type of join
that you require.
If the names of the columns used to join the two tables
are identical, which is true in the previous query, you can
use the using subclause instead of the on subclause, as
in:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname, d.name
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN department d
-> USING (dept_id);
+----------+-----------+----------------+
| fname | lname | name |
+----------+-----------+----------------+

| Frank | Portman | Operations |
| Theresa | Markham | Operations |
| Beth | Fowler | Operations |
| Rick | Tulman | Operations |
+----------+-----------+----------------+
18 rows in set (0.01 sec)
Since using is a shorthand notation that you can use in
only a specific situation, I prefer always to use the on
subclause to avoid confusion.
The ANSI Join Syntax
The notation used throughout this book for joining tables
was introduced in the SQL92 version of the ANSI SQL
standard. All the major databases (Oracle Database,
Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, IBM DB2 Universal
Database, and Sybase Adaptive Server) have adopted the
SQL92 join syntax. Because most of these servers have
been around since before the release of the SQL92
specification, they all include an older join syntax as well.
For example, all these servers would understand the
following variation of the previous query:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname, d.name
-> FROM employee e, department d
-> WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
+----------+-----------+----------------+
| fname | lname | name |
+----------+-----------+----------------+
| Michael | Smith | Administration |
| Susan | Barker | Administration |
| Robert | Tyler | Administration |
| Susan | Hawthorne | Operations |
| John | Gooding | Loans |
| Helen | Fleming | Operations |
| Chris | Tucker | Operations |
| Sarah | Parker | Operations |
| Jane | Grossman | Operations |
| Paula | Roberts | Operations |
| Thomas | Ziegler | Operations |
| Samantha | Jameson | Operations |
| John | Blake | Operations |
| Cindy | Mason | Operations |
| Frank | Portman | Operations |
| Theresa | Markham | Operations |
| Beth | Fowler | Operations |
| Rick | Tulman | Operations |
+----------+-----------+----------------+
18 rows in set (0.01 sec)

This older method of specifying joins does not include the
on subclause; instead, tables are named in the from
clause separated by commas, and join conditions are
included in the where clause. While you may decide to
ignore the SQL92 syntax in favor of the older join syntax,
the ANSI join syntax has the following advantages:
Join conditions and filter conditions are separated
into two different clauses (the on subclause and the
where clause, respectively), making a query easier to
understand.
The join conditions for each pair of tables are
contained in their own on clause, making it less likely
that part of a join will be mistakenly omitted.
Queries that use the SQL92 join syntax are portable
across database servers, whereas the older syntax is
slightly different across the different servers.
The benefits of the SQL92 join syntax are easier to
identify for complex queries that include both join and
filter conditions. Consider the following query, which
returns all accounts opened by experienced tellers (hired
prior to 2007) currently assigned to the Woburn branch:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, a.open_date,
a.product_cd
-> FROM account a, branch b, employee e
-> WHERE a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> AND e.start_date < '2007-01-01'
-> AND e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> AND (e.title = 'Teller' OR e.title = 'Head Teller')
-> AND b.name = 'Woburn Branch';
+------------+---------+------------+------------+
| account_id | cust_id | open_date | product_cd |
+------------+---------+------------+------------+
| 1 | 1 | 2000-01-15 | CHK |
| 2 | 1 | 2000-01-15 | SAV |
| 3 | 1 | 2004-06-30 | CD |
| 4 | 2 | 2001-03-12 | CHK |
| 5 | 2 | 2001-03-12 | SAV |
| 17 | 7 | 2004-01-12 | CD |
| 27 | 11 | 2004-03-22 | BUS |
+------------+---------+------------+------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
With this query, it is not so easy to determine which
conditions in the where clause are join conditions and

which are filter conditions. It is also not readily apparent
which type of join is being employed (to identify the type
of join, you would need to look closely at the join
conditions in the where clause to see whether any special
characters are employed), nor is it easy to determine
whether any join conditions have been mistakenly left
out. Here’s the same query using the SQL92 join syntax:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, a.open_date,
a.product_cd
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> WHERE e.start_date < '2007-01-01'
-> AND (e.title = 'Teller' OR e.title = 'Head Teller')
-> AND b.name = 'Woburn Branch';
+------------+---------+------------+------------+
| account_id | cust_id | open_date | product_cd |
+------------+---------+------------+------------+
| 1 | 1 | 2000-01-15 | CHK |
| 2 | 1 | 2000-01-15 | SAV |
| 3 | 1 | 2004-06-30 | CD |
| 4 | 2 | 2001-03-12 | CHK |
| 5 | 2 | 2001-03-12 | SAV |
| 17 | 7 | 2004-01-12 | CD |
| 27 | 11 | 2004-03-22 | BUS |
+------------+---------+------------+------------+
7 rows in set (0.05 sec)
Hopefully, you will agree that the version using SQL92
join syntax is easier to understand.

Joining Three or More Tables
Joining three tables is similar to joining two tables, but
with one slight wrinkle. With a two-table join, there are
two tables and one join type in the from clause, and a
single on subclause to define how the tables are joined.
With a three-table join, there are three tables and two
join types in the from clause, and two on subclauses.
Here’s another example of a query with a two-table join:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, c.fed_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN customer c
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+
| account_id | fed_id |
+------------+------------+
| 24 | 04-1111111 |
| 25 | 04-1111111 |
| 27 | 04-2222222 |
| 28 | 04-3333333 |
| 29 | 04-4444444 |
+------------+------------+
5 rows in set (0.15 sec)
This query, which returns the account ID and federal tax
number for all business accounts, should look fairly
straightforward by now. If, however, you add the
employee table to the query to also retrieve the name of
the teller who opened each account, it looks as follows:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, c.fed_id, e.fname, e.lname
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN customer c
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
| account_id | fed_id | fname | lname |
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
| 24 | 04-1111111 | Theresa | Markham |
| 25 | 04-1111111 | Theresa | Markham |
| 27 | 04-2222222 | Paula | Roberts |
| 28 | 04-3333333 | Theresa | Markham |
| 29 | 04-4444444 | John | Blake |
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Now three tables, two join types, and two on subclauses
are listed in the from clause, so things have gotten quite

a bit busier. At first glance, the order in which the tables
are named might cause you to think that the employee
table is being joined to the customer table, since the
account table is named first, followed by the customer
table, and then the employee table. If you switch the
order in which the first two tables appear, however, you
will get the exact same results:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, c.fed_id, e.fname, e.lname
-> FROM customer c INNER JOIN account a
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
| account_id | fed_id | fname | lname |
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
| 24 | 04-1111111 | Theresa | Markham |
| 25 | 04-1111111 | Theresa | Markham |
| 27 | 04-2222222 | Paula | Roberts |
| 28 | 04-3333333 | Theresa | Markham |
| 29 | 04-4444444 | John | Blake |
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
5 rows in set (0.09 sec)
The customer table is now listed first, followed by the
account table and then the employee table. Since the on
subclauses haven’t changed, the results are the same.
For the sake of completeness, here’s the same query one
last time, but with the table order completely reversed
(employee to account to customer):
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, c.fed_id, e.fname, e.lname
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN account a
-> ON e.emp_id = a.open_emp_id
-> INNER JOIN customer c
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
| account_id | fed_id | fname | lname |
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
| 24 | 04-1111111 | Theresa | Markham |
| 25 | 04-1111111 | Theresa | Markham |
| 27 | 04-2222222 | Paula | Roberts |
| 28 | 04-3333333 | Theresa | Markham |
| 29 | 04-4444444 | John | Blake |
+------------+------------+---------+---------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Does Join Order Matter?

If you are confused about why all three versions of the
account/employee/customer query yield the same
results, keep in mind that SQL is a nonprocedural
language, meaning that you describe what you want to
retrieve and which database objects need to be
involved, but it is up to the database server to
determine how best to execute your query. Using
statistics gathered from your database objects, the
server must pick one of three tables as a starting point
(the chosen table is thereafter known as the driving
table), and then decide in which order to join the
remaining tables. Therefore, the order in which tables
appear in your from clause is not significant.
If, however, you believe that the tables in your query
should always be joined in a particular order, you can
place the tables in the desired order and then specify
the keyword STRAIGHT_JOIN in MySQL, request the
FORCE ORDER option in SQL Server, or use either the
ORDERED or the LEADING optimizer hint in Oracle
Database. For example, to tell the MySQL server to use
the customer table as the driving table and to then join
the account and employee tables, you could do the
following:
mysql> SELECT STRAIGHT_JOIN a.account_id, c.fed_id, e.fname,
e.lname
-> FROM customer c INNER JOIN account a
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
One way to think of a query that uses three or more
tables is as a snowball rolling down a hill. The first two
tables get the ball rolling, and each subsequent table
gets tacked on to the snowball as it heads downhill. You
can think of the snowball as the intermediate result set,
which is picking up more and more columns as
subsequent tables are joined. Therefore, the employee
table is not really being joined to the account table, but
rather the intermediate result set created when the
customer and account tables were joined. (In case you

were wondering why I chose a snowball analogy, I wrote
this chapter in the midst of a New England winter: 110
inches so far, and more coming tomorrow. Oh joy.)
Using Subqueries As Tables
You have already seen several examples of queries that
use three tables, but there is one variation worth
mentioning: what to do if some of the data sets are
generated by subqueries. Subqueries is the focus of
Chapter 9, but I already introduced the concept of a
subquery in the from clause in the previous chapter.
Here’s another version of an earlier query (find all
accounts opened by experienced tellers currently
assigned to the Woburn branch) that joins the account
table to subqueries against the branch and employee
tables:
1 SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, a.open_date, a.product_cd
2 FROM account a INNER JOIN
3 (SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
4 FROM employee
5 WHERE start_date < '2007-01-01'
6 AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')) e
7 ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
8 INNER JOIN
9 (SELECT branch_id
10 FROM branch
11 WHERE name = 'Woburn Branch') b
12 ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id;
The first subquery, which starts on line 3 and is given the
alias e, finds all experienced tellers. The second
subquery, which starts on line 9 and is given the alias b,
finds the ID of the Woburn branch. First, the account
table is joined to the experienced-teller subquery using
the employee ID and then the table that results is joined
to the Woburn branch subquery using the branch ID. The
results are the same as those of the previous version of
the query (try it and see for yourself), but the queries
look very different from one another.
There isn’t really anything shocking here, but it might
take a minute to figure out what’s going on. Notice, for
example, the lack of a where clause in the main query;
since all the filter conditions are against the employee

and branch tables, the filter conditions are all inside the
subqueries, so there is no need for any filter conditions in
the main query. One way to visualize what is going on is
to run the subqueries and look at the result sets. Here
are the results of the first subquery against the employee
table:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE start_date < '2007-01-01'
-> AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller');
+--------+--------------------+
| emp_id | assigned_branch_id |
+--------+--------------------+
| 8 | 1 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 2 |
| 13 | 3 |
| 14 | 3 |
| 16 | 4 |
| 17 | 4 |
| 18 | 4 |
+--------+--------------------+
9 rows in set (0.03 sec)
Thus, this result set consists of a set of employee IDs and
their corresponding branch IDs. When they are joined to
the account table via the emp_id column, you now have
an intermediate result set consisting of all rows from the
account table with the additional column holding the
branch ID of the employee that opened each account.
Here are the results of the second subquery against the
branch table:
mysql> SELECT branch_id
-> FROM branch
-> WHERE name = 'Woburn Branch';
+-----------+
| branch_id |
+-----------+
| 2 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
This query returns a single row containing a single
column: the ID of the Woburn branch. This table is joined
to the assigned_branch_id column of the intermediate

result set, causing all accounts opened by non-Woburn-
based employees to be filtered out of the final result set.
Using the Same Table Twice
If you are joining multiple tables, you might find that you
need to join the same table more than once. In the
sample database, for example, there are foreign keys to
the branch table from both the account table (the branch
at which the account was opened) and the employee
table (the branch at which the employee works). If you
want to include both branches in your result set, you can
include the branch table twice in the from clause, joined
once to the employee table and once to the account
table. For this to work, you will need to give each
instance of the branch table a different alias so that the
server knows which one you are referring to in the
various clauses, as in:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, e.emp_id,
-> b_a.name open_branch, b_e.name emp_branch
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN branch b_a
-> ON a.open_branch_id = b_a.branch_id
-> INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> INNER JOIN branch b_e
-> ON e.assigned_branch_id = b_e.branch_id
-> WHERE a.product_cd = 'CHK';
+------------+--------+---------------+---------------+
| account_id | emp_id | open_branch | emp_branch |
+------------+--------+---------------+---------------+
| 10 | 1 | Headquarters | Headquarters |
| 14 | 1 | Headquarters | Headquarters |
| 21 | 1 | Headquarters | Headquarters |
| 1 | 10 | Woburn Branch | Woburn Branch |
| 4 | 10 | Woburn Branch | Woburn Branch |
| 7 | 13 | Quincy Branch | Quincy Branch |
| 13 | 16 | So. NH Branch | So. NH Branch |
| 18 | 16 | So. NH Branch | So. NH Branch |
| 24 | 16 | So. NH Branch | So. NH Branch |
| 28 | 16 | So. NH Branch | So. NH Branch |
+------------+--------+---------------+---------------+
10 rows in set (0.16 sec)
This query shows who opened each checking account,
what branch it was opened at, and to which branch the
employee who opened the account is currently assigned.
The branch table is included twice, with aliases b_a and

b_e. By assigning different aliases to each instance of the
branch table, the server is able to understand which
instance you are referring to: the one joined to the
account table, or the one joined to the employee table.
Therefore, this is one example of a query that requires
the use of table aliases.

Self-Joins
Not only can you include the same table more than once
in the same query, but you can actually join a table to
itself. This might seem like a strange thing to do at first,
but there are valid reasons for doing so. The employee
table, for example, includes a self-referencing foreign
key, which means that it includes a column
(superior_emp_id) that points to the primary key within
the same table. This column points to the employee’s
manager (unless the employee is the head honcho, in
which case the column is null). Using a self-join, you can
write a query that lists every employee’s name along
with the name of his or her manager:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
-> e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN employee e_mgr
-> ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| fname | lname | mgr_fname | mgr_lname |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Susan | Barker | Michael | Smith |
| Robert | Tyler | Michael | Smith |
| Susan | Hawthorne | Robert | Tyler |
| John | Gooding | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Helen | Fleming | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Chris | Tucker | Helen | Fleming |
| Sarah | Parker | Helen | Fleming |
| Jane | Grossman | Helen | Fleming |
| Paula | Roberts | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Thomas | Ziegler | Paula | Roberts |
| Samantha | Jameson | Paula | Roberts |
| John | Blake | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Cindy | Mason | John | Blake |
| Frank | Portman | John | Blake |
| Theresa | Markham | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Beth | Fowler | Theresa | Markham |
| Rick | Tulman | Theresa | Markham |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
17 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query includes two instances of the employee table:
one to provide employee names (with the table alias e),
and the other to provide manager names (with the table
alias e_mgr). The on subclause uses these aliases to join
the employee table to itself via the superior_emp_id

foreign key. This is another example of a query for which
table aliases are required; otherwise, the server wouldn’t
know whether you are referring to an employee or an
employee’s manager.
While there are 18 rows in the employee table, the query
returned only 17 rows; the president of the bank,
Michael Smith, has no superior (his superior_emp_id
column is null), so the join failed for his row. To include
Michael Smith in the result set, you would need to use an
outer join, which we cover in Chapter 10.

Equi-Joins Versus Non-Equi-Joins
All of the multitable queries shown thus far have
employed equi-joins, meaning that values from the two
tables must match for the join to succeed. An equi-join
always employs an equals sign, as in:
ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id
While the majority of your queries will employ equi-joins,
you can also join your tables via ranges of values, which
are referred to as non-equi-joins. Here’s an example of a
query that joins by a range of values:
SELECT e.emp_id, e.fname, e.lname, e.start_date
FROM employee e INNER JOIN product p
ON e.start_date >= p.date_offered
AND e.start_date <= p.date_retired
WHERE p.name = 'no-fee checking';
This query joins two tables that have no foreign key
relationships. The intent is to find all employees who
began working for the bank while the No-Fee Checking
product was being offered. Thus, an employee’s start
date must be between the date the product was offered
and the date the product was retired.
You may also find a need for a self-non-equi-join, meaning
that a table is joined to itself using a non-equi-join. For
example, let’s say that the operations manager has
decided to have a chess tournament for all bank tellers.
You have been asked to create a list of all the pairings.
You might try joining the employee table to itself for all
tellers (title = 'Teller') and return all rows where
the emp_ids don’t match (since a person can’t play chess
against himself):
mysql> SELECT e1.fname, e1.lname, 'VS' vs, e2.fname, e2.lname
-> FROM employee e1 INNER JOIN employee e2
-> ON e1.emp_id != e2.emp_id
-> WHERE e1.title = 'Teller' AND e2.title = 'Teller';
+----------+----------+----+----------+----------+
| fname | lname | vs | fname | lname |
+----------+----------+----+----------+----------+
| Sarah | Parker | VS | Chris | Tucker |
| Jane | Grossman | VS | Chris | Tucker |
| Thomas | Ziegler | VS | Chris | Tucker |
| Samantha | Jameson | VS | Chris | Tucker |
| Cindy | Mason | VS | Chris | Tucker |
| Frank | Portman | VS | Chris | Tucker |

| Beth | Fowler | VS | Chris | Tucker |

| Jane | Grossman | VS | Sarah | Parker |
| Thomas | Ziegler | VS | Sarah | Parker |
| Samantha | Jameson | VS | Sarah | Parker |
| Cindy | Mason | VS | Sarah | Parker |
| Frank | Portman | VS | Sarah | Parker |
| Beth | Fowler | VS | Sarah | Parker |
| Rick | Tulman | VS | Sarah | Parker |
...
| Chris | Tucker | VS | Rick | Tulman |
| Sarah | Parker | VS | Rick | Tulman |
| Jane | Grossman | VS | Rick | Tulman |
| Thomas | Ziegler | VS | Rick | Tulman |
| Samantha | Jameson | VS | Rick | Tulman |

| Frank | Portman | VS | Rick | Tulman |
| Beth | Fowler | VS | Rick | Tulman |
+----------+----------+----+----------+----------+
72 rows in set (0.01 sec)
You’re on the right track, but the problem here is that for
each pairing (e.g., Sarah Parker versus Chris Tucker),
there is also a reverse pairing (e.g., Chris Tucker versus
Sarah Parker). One way to achieve the desired results is
to use the join condition e1.emp_id < e2.emp_id so that
each teller is paired only with those tellers having a
higher employee ID (you can also use e1.emp_id >
e2.emp_id if you wish):
mysql> SELECT e1.fname, e1.lname, 'VS' vs, e2.fname, e2.lname
-> FROM employee e1 INNER JOIN employee e2
-> ON e1.emp_id < e2.emp_id
-> WHERE e1.title = 'Teller' AND e2.title = 'Teller';
+----------+----------+----+----------+----------+

36 rows in set (0.00 sec)
You now have a list of 36 pairings, which is the correct
number when choosing pairs of 9 distinct things.

Join Conditions Versus Filter Conditions
You are now familiar with the concept that join
conditions belong in the on subclause, while filter
conditions belong in the where clause. However, SQL is
flexible as to where you place your conditions, so you will
need to take care when constructing your queries. For
example, the following query joins two tables using a
single join condition, and also includes a single filter
condition in the where clause:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, c.fed_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN customer c
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> WHERE c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+------------+
| account_id | product_cd | fed_id |
+------------+------------+------------+
| 24 | CHK | 04-1111111 |
| 25 | BUS | 04-1111111 |
| 27 | BUS | 04-2222222 |
| 28 | CHK | 04-3333333 |
| 29 | SBL | 04-4444444 |
+------------+------------+------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
That was pretty straightforward, but what happens if you
mistakenly put the filter condition in the on subclause
instead of in the where clause?
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, c.fed_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN customer c
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> AND c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+------------+
| account_id | product_cd | fed_id |
+------------+------------+------------+
| 24 | CHK | 04-1111111 |
| 25 | BUS | 04-1111111 |
| 27 | BUS | 04-2222222 |
| 28 | CHK | 04-3333333 |
| 29 | SBL | 04-4444444 |
+------------+------------+------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
As you can see, the second version, which has both
conditions in the on subclause and has no where clause,
generates the same results. What if both conditions are
placed in the where clause but the from clause still uses
the ANSI join syntax?

mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, c.fed_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN customer c
-> WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> AND c.cust_type_cd = 'B';
+------------+------------+------------+
| account_id | product_cd | fed_id |
+------------+------------+------------+
| 24 | CHK | 04-1111111 |
| 25 | BUS | 04-1111111 |
| 27 | BUS | 04-2222222 |
| 28 | CHK | 04-3333333 |
| 29 | SBL | 04-4444444 |
+------------+------------+------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
Once again, the MySQL server has generated the same
result set. It will be up to you to put your conditions in
the proper place so that your queries are easy to
understand and maintain.

Chapter 6. Working with Sets
Although you can interact with the data in a database
one row at a time, relational databases are really all
about sets. You have seen how you can create tables via
queries or subqueries, make them persistent via insert
statements, and bring them together via joins; this
chapter explores how you can combine multiple tables
using various set operators.
Set Theory Primer
In many parts of the world, basic set theory is included in
elementary-level math curriculums. Perhaps you recall
looking at something like what is shown in Figure 6-1.
Figure 6-1. The union operation
The shaded area in Figure 6-1 represents the union of
sets A and B, which is the combination of the two sets
(with any overlapping regions included only once). Is this
starting to look familiar? If so, then you’ll finally get a
chance to put that knowledge to use; if not, don’t worry,
because it’s easy to visualize using a couple of diagrams.
Using circles to represent two data sets (A and B),
imagine a subset of data that is common to both sets; this
common data is represented by the overlapping area
shown in Figure 6-1. Since set theory is rather
uninteresting without an overlap between data sets, I use

the same diagram to illustrate each set operation. There
is another set operation that is concerned only with the
overlap between two data sets; this operation is known
as the intersection and is demonstrated in Figure 6-2.
Figure 6-2. The intersection operation
The data set generated by the intersection of sets A and
B is just the area of overlap between the two sets. If the
two sets have no overlap, then the intersection operation
yields the empty set.
The third and final set operation, which is demonstrated
in Figure 6-3, is known as the except operation.

Figure 6-3. The except operation
Figure 6-3 shows the results of A except B, which is the
whole of set A minus any overlap with set B. If the two
sets have no overlap, then the operation A except B
yields the whole of set A.
Using these three operations, or by combining different
operations together, you can generate whatever results
you need. For example, imagine that you want to build a
set demonstrated by Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-4. Mystery data set

The data set you are looking for includes all of sets A and
B without the overlapping region. You can’t achieve this
outcome with just one of the three operations shown
earlier; instead, you will need to first build a data set that
encompasses all of sets A and B, and then utilize a
second operation to remove the overlapping region. If
the combined set is described as A union B, and the
overlapping region is described as A intersect B, then
the operation needed to generate the data set
represented by Figure 6-4 would look as follows:
(A union B) except (A intersect B)
Of course, there are often multiple ways to achieve the
same results; you could reach a similar outcome using
the following operation:
(A except B) union (B except A)
While these concepts are fairly easy to understand using
diagrams, the next sections show you how these concepts
are applied to a relational database using the SQL set
operators.

Set Theory in Practice
The circles used in the previous section’s diagrams to
represent data sets don’t convey anything about what the
data sets comprise. When dealing with actual data,
however, there is a need to describe the composition of
the data sets involved if they are to be combined.
Imagine, for example, what would happen if you tried to
generate the union of the product table and the
customer table, whose table definitions are as follows:
mysql> DESC product;
+-----------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+------
-+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra
|
+-----------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+------
-+
| product_cd | varchar(10) | NO | PRI | NULL |
|
| name | varchar(50) | NO | | NULL |
|
| product_type_cd | varchar(10) | NO | MUL | NULL |
|
| date_offered | date | YES | | NULL |
|
| date_retired | date | YES | | NULL |
|
+-----------------+-------------+------+-----+---------+------
-+
5 rows in set (0.23 sec)
mysql> DESC customer;
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
------------+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default |
Extra |
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
------------+
| cust_id | int(10) unsigned | NO | PRI | NULL |
auto_increment |
| fed_id | varchar(12) | NO | | NULL |
|
| cust_type_cd | enum('I','B') | NO | | NULL |
|
| address | varchar(30) | YES | | NULL |
|
| city | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| state | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|

| postal_code | varchar(10) | YES | | NULL |
|
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
------------+
7 rows in set (0.04 sec)
When combined, the first column in the table that results
would be the combination of the product.product_cd
and customer.cust_id columns, the second column
would be the combination of the product.name and
customer.fed_id columns, and so forth. While some of
the column pairs are easy to combine (e.g., two numeric
columns), it is unclear how other column pairs should be
combined, such as a numeric column with a string
column or a string column with a date column.
Additionally, the sixth and seventh columns of the
combined tables would include data from only the
customer table’s sixth and seventh columns, since the
product table has only five columns. Clearly, there needs
to be some commonality between two tables that you
wish to combine.
Therefore, when performing set operations on two data
sets, the following guidelines must apply:
Both data sets must have the same number of
columns.
The data types of each column across the two data
sets must be the same (or the server must be able to
convert one to the other).
With these rules in place, it is easier to envision what
“overlapping data” means in practice; each column pair
from the two sets being combined must contain the same
string, number, or date for rows in the two tables to be
considered the same.
You perform a set operation by placing a set operator
between two select statements, as demonstrated by the
following:
mysql> SELECT 1 num, 'abc' str
-> UNION
-> SELECT 9 num, 'xyz' str;
+-----+-----+
| num | str |
+-----+-----+

| 1 | abc |
| 9 | xyz |
+-----+-----+
2 rows in set (0.02 sec)
Each of the individual queries yields a data set consisting
of a single row having a numeric column and a string
column. The set operator, which in this case is union,
tells the database server to combine all rows from the
two sets. Thus, the final set includes two rows of two
columns. This query is known as a compound query
because it comprises multiple, otherwise-independent
queries. As you will see later, compound queries may
include more than two queries if multiple set operations
are needed to attain the final results.

Set Operators
The SQL language includes three set operators that allow
you to perform each of the various set operations
described earlier in the chapter. Additionally, each set
operator has two flavors, one that includes duplicates
and another that removes duplicates (but not necessarily
all of the duplicates). The following subsections define
each operator and demonstrate how they are used.
The union Operator
The union and union all operators allow you to
combine multiple data sets. The difference between the
two is that union sorts the combined set and removes
duplicates, whereas union all does not. With union
all, the number of rows in the final data set will always
equal the sum of the number of rows in the sets being
combined. This operation is the simplest set operation to
perform (from the server’s point of view), since there is
no need for the server to check for overlapping data. The
following example demonstrates how you can use the
union all operator to generate a full set of customer
data from the two customer subtype tables:
mysql> SELECT 'IND' type_cd, cust_id, lname name
-> FROM individual
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'BUS' type_cd, cust_id, name
-> FROM business;
+---------+---------+------------------------+
| type_cd | cust_id | name |
+---------+---------+------------------------+
| IND | 1 | Hadley |
| IND | 2 | Tingley |
| IND | 3 | Tucker |
| IND | 4 | Hayward |
| IND | 5 | Frasier |
| IND | 6 | Spencer |
| IND | 7 | Young |
| IND | 8 | Blake |
| IND | 9 | Farley |
| BUS | 10 | Chilton Engineering |
| BUS | 11 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| BUS | 12 | Superior Auto Body |
| BUS | 13 | AAA Insurance Inc. |

+---------+---------+------------------------+
13 rows in set (0.04 sec)
The query returns all 13 customers, with nine rows
coming from the individual table and the other four
coming from the business table. While the business
table includes a single column to hold the company
name, the individual table includes two name columns,
one each for the person’s first and last names. In this
case, I chose to include only the last name from the
individual table.
Just to drive home the point that the union all operator
doesn’t remove duplicates, here’s the same query as the
previous example but with an additional query against
the business table:
mysql> SELECT 'IND' type_cd, cust_id, lname name
-> FROM individual
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'BUS' type_cd, cust_id, name
-> FROM business
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'BUS' type_cd, cust_id, name
-> FROM business;
+---------+---------+------------------------+
| type_cd | cust_id | name |
+---------+---------+------------------------+
| IND | 1 | Hadley |
| IND | 2 | Tingley |
| IND | 3 | Tucker |
| IND | 4 | Hayward |
| IND | 5 | Frasier |
| IND | 6 | Spencer |
| IND | 7 | Young |
| IND | 8 | Blake |

17 rows in set (0.01 sec)
This compound query includes three select statements,
two of which are identical. As you can see by the results,

the four rows from the business table are included twice
(customer IDs 10, 11, 12, and 13).
While you are unlikely to repeat the same query twice in
a compound query, here is another compound query that
returns duplicate data:
mysql> SELECT emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE assigned_branch_id = 2
-> AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT DISTINCT open_emp_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE open_branch_id = 2;
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
| 10 |
+--------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The first query in the compound statement retrieves all
tellers assigned to the Woburn branch, whereas the
second query returns the distinct set of tellers who
opened accounts at the Woburn branch. Of the four rows
in the result set, one of them is a duplicate (employee ID
10). If you would like your combined table to exclude
duplicate rows, you need to use the union operator
instead of union all:
mysql> SELECT emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE assigned_branch_id = 2
-> AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')
-> UNION
-> SELECT DISTINCT open_emp_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE open_branch_id = 2;
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
+--------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

For this version of the query, only the three distinct rows
are included in the result set, rather than the four rows
(three distinct, one duplicate) returned when using union
all.
The intersect Operator
The ANSI SQL specification includes the intersect
operator for performing intersections. Unfortunately,
version 6.0 of MySQL does not implement the intersect
operator. If you are using Oracle or SQL Server 2008,
you will be able to use intersect; since I am using
MySQL for all examples in this book, however, the result
sets for the example queries in this section are fabricated
and cannot be executed with any versions up to and
including version 6.0. I also refrain from showing the
MySQL prompt (mysql>), since the statements are not
being executed by the MySQL server.
If the two queries in a compound query return
nonoverlapping data sets, then the intersection will be an
empty set. Consider the following query:
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
FROM employee
INTERSECT
SELECT cust_id, fname, lname
FROM individual;
Empty set (0.04 sec)
The first query returns the ID and name of each
employee, while the second query returns the ID and
name of each customer. These sets are completely
nonoverlapping, so the intersection of the two sets yields
the empty set.
The next step is to identify two queries that do have
overlapping data and then apply the intersect operator.
For this purpose, I use the same query used to
demonstrate the difference between union and union
all, except this time using intersect:
SELECT emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE assigned_branch_id = 2
AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')
INTERSECT
SELECT DISTINCT open_emp_id

FROM account
WHERE open_branch_id = 2;
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 10 |
+--------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
The intersection of these two queries yields employee ID
10, which is the only value found in both queries’ result
sets.
Along with the intersect operator, which removes any
duplicate rows found in the overlapping region, the ANSI
SQL specification calls for an intersect all operator,
which does not remove duplicates. The only database
server that currently implements the intersect all
operator is IBM’s DB2 Universal Server.
The except Operator
The ANSI SQL specification includes the except operator
for performing the except operation. Once again,
unfortunately, version 6.0 of MySQL does not implement
the except operator, so the same rules apply for this
section as for the previous section.
Note ✎
If you are using Oracle Database, you will need to
use the non-ANSI-compliant minus operator instead.
The except operator returns the first table minus any
overlap with the second table. Here’s the example from
the previous section, but using except instead of
intersect:
SELECT emp_id
FROM employee
WHERE assigned_branch_id = 2
AND (title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller')
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT open_emp_id
FROM account
WHERE open_branch_id = 2;
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 11 |
| 12 |

+--------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
In this version of the query, the result set consists of the
three rows from the first query minus employee ID 10,
which is found in the result sets from both queries. There
is also an except all operator specified in the ANSI SQL
specification, but once again, only IBM’s DB2 Universal
Server has implemented the except all operator.
The except all operator is a bit tricky, so here’s an
example to demonstrate how duplicate data is handled.
Let’s say you have two data sets that look as follows:
Set A
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
+--------+
Set B
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 10 |
| 10 |
+--------+
The operation A except B yields the following:
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 11 |
| 12 |
+--------+
If you change the operation to A except all B, you will
see the following:
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
+--------+
Therefore, the difference between the two operations is
that except removes all occurrences of duplicate data

from set A, whereas except all only removes one
occurrence of duplicate data from set A for every
occurrence in set B.

Set Operation Rules
The following sections outline some rules that you must
follow when working with compound queries.
Sorting Compound Query Results
If you want the results of your compound query to be
sorted, you can add an order by clause after the last
query. When specifying column names in the order by
clause, you will need to choose from the column names in
the first query of the compound query. Frequently, the
column names are the same for both queries in a
compound query, but this does not need to be the case,
as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Teller'
-> UNION
-> SELECT open_emp_id, open_branch_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd = 'SAV'
-> ORDER BY emp_id;
+--------+--------------------+
| emp_id | assigned_branch_id |
+--------+--------------------+
| 1 | 1 |
| 7 | 1 |
| 8 | 1 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 2 |
| 11 | 2 |
| 12 | 2 |
| 14 | 3 |
| 15 | 3 |
| 16 | 4 |
| 17 | 4 |
| 18 | 4 |
+--------+--------------------+
12 rows in set (0.04 sec)
The column names specified in the two queries are
different in this example. If you specify a column name
from the second query in your order by clause, you will
see the following error:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, assigned_branch_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Teller'
-> UNION

-> SELECT open_emp_id, open_branch_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd = 'SAV'
-> ORDER BY open_emp_id;
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'open_emp_id' in 'order
clause'
I recommend giving the columns in both queries identical
column aliases in order to avoid this issue.
Set Operation Precedence
If your compound query contains more than two queries
using different set operators, you need to think about the
order in which to place the queries in your compound
statement to achieve the desired results. Consider the
following three-query compound statement:
mysql> SELECT cust_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd IN ('SAV', 'MM')
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT a.cust_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON a.open_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> WHERE b.name = 'Woburn Branch'
-> UNION
-> SELECT cust_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE avail_balance BETWEEN 500 AND 2500;
+---------+
| cust_id |
+---------+
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 7 |
| 11 |
| 5 |
+---------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This compound query includes three queries that return
sets of nonunique customer IDs; the first and second
queries are separated with the union all operator, while
the second and third queries are separated with the
union operator. While it might not seem to make much
difference where the union and union all operators are

placed, it does, in fact, make a difference. Here’s the
same compound query with the set operators reversed:
mysql> SELECT cust_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd IN ('SAV', 'MM')
-> UNION
-> SELECT a.cust_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON a.open_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> WHERE b.name = 'Woburn Branch'
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT cust_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE avail_balance BETWEEN 500 AND 2500;
+---------+
| cust_id |
+---------+
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 7 |
| 11 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 9 |
+---------+
17 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Looking at the results, it’s obvious that it does make a
difference how the compound query is arranged when
using different set operators. In general, compound
queries containing three or more queries are evaluated
in order from top to bottom, but with the following
caveats:
The ANSI SQL specification calls for the intersect
operator to have precedence over the other set
operators.
You may dictate the order in which queries are
combined by enclosing multiple queries in

parentheses.
However, since MySQL does not yet implement
intersect or allow parentheses in compound queries,
you will need to carefully arrange the queries in your
compound query so that you achieve the desired results.
If you are using a different database server, you can wrap
adjoining queries in parentheses to override the default
top-to-bottom processing of compound queries, as in:
(SELECT cust_id
FROM account
WHERE product_cd IN ('SAV', 'MM')
UNION ALL
SELECT a.cust_id
FROM account a INNER JOIN branch b
ON a.open_branch_id = b.branch_id
WHERE b.name = 'Woburn Branch')
INTERSECT
(SELECT cust_id
FROM account
WHERE avail_balance BETWEEN 500 AND 2500
EXCEPT
SELECT cust_id
FROM account
WHERE product_cd = 'CD'
AND avail_balance < 1000);
For this compound query, the first and second queries
would be combined using the union all operator, then
the third and fourth queries would be combined using
the except operator, and finally, the results from these
two operations would be combined using the intersect
operator to generate the final result set.

names of all individual customers along with the first and
last names of all employees.
Exercise 6-3
Sort the results from Exercise 6-2 by the lname column.

Chapter 7. Data Generation, Conversion,
and Manipulation
As I mentioned in the Preface, this book strives to teach
generic SQL techniques that can be applied across
multiple database servers. This chapter, however, deals
with the generation, conversion, and manipulation of
string, numeric, and temporal data, and the SQL
language does not include commands covering this
functionality. Rather, built-in functions are used to
facilitate data generation, conversion, and manipulation,
and while the SQL standard does specify some functions,
the database vendors often do not comply with the
function specifications.
Therefore, my approach for this chapter is to show you
some of the common ways in which data is manipulated
within SQL statements, and then demonstrate some of
the built-in functions implemented by Microsoft SQL
Server, Oracle Database, and MySQL. Along with reading
this chapter, I strongly recommend you purchase a
reference guide covering all the functions implemented
by your server. If you work with more than one database
server, there are several reference guides that cover
multiple servers, such as Kevin Kline et al.’s SQL in a
Nutshell and Jonathan Gennick’s SQL Pocket Guide ,
both from O’Reilly.
Working with String Data
When working with string data, you will be using one of
the following character data types:
CHAR
Holds fixed-length, blank-padded strings. MySQL
allows CHAR values up to 255 characters in length,
Oracle Database permits up to 2,000 characters, and
SQL Server allows up to 8,000 characters.
varchar
Holds variable-length strings. MySQL permits up to
65,535 characters in a varchar column, Oracle
Database (via the varchar2 type) allows up to 4,000

characters, and SQL Server allows up to 8,000
characters.
text (MySQL and SQL Server) or CLOB (Character Large
Object; Oracle Database)
Holds very large variable-length strings (generally
referred to as documents in this context). MySQL has
multiple text types (tinytext, text, mediumtext, and
longtext) for documents up to 4 GB in size. SQL
Server has a single text type for documents up to 2
GB in size, and Oracle Database includes the CLOB
data type, which can hold documents up to a
whopping 128 TB. SQL Server 2005 also includes the
varchar(max) data type and recommends its use
instead of the text type, which will be removed from
the server in some future release.
To demonstrate how you can use these various types, I
use the following table for some of the examples in this
section:
CREATE TABLE string_tbl
(char_fld CHAR(30),
vchar_fld VARCHAR(30),
text_fld TEXT
);
The next two subsections show how you can generate
and manipulate string data.
String Generation
The simplest way to populate a character column is to
enclose a string in quotes, as in:
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl (char_fld, vchar_fld, text_fld)
-> VALUES ('This is char data',
-> 'This is varchar data',
-> 'This is text data');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
When inserting string data into a table, remember that if
the length of the string exceeds the maximum size for the
character column (either the designated maximum or the
maximum allowed for the data type), the server will
throw an exception. Although this is the default behavior
for all three servers, you can configure MySQL and SQL
Server to silently truncate the string instead of throwing

an exception. To demonstrate how MySQL handles this
situation, the following update statement attempts to
modify the vchar_fld column, whose maximum length is
defined as 30, with a string that is 46 characters in
length:
mysql> UPDATE string_tbl
-> SET vchar_fld = 'This is a piece of extremely long
varchar data';
ERROR 1406 (22001): Data too long for column 'vchar_fld' at
row 1
With MySQL 6.0, the default behavior is now “strict”
mode, which means that exceptions are thrown when
problems arise, whereas in older versions of the server
the string would have been truncated and a warning
issued. If you would rather have the engine truncate the
string and issue a warning instead of raising an
exception, you can opt to be in ANSI mode. The following
example shows how to check which mode you are in, and
then how to change the mode using the SET command:
mysql> SELECT @@session.sql_mode;
+-------------------------------------------------------------
---+
| @@session.sql_mode
|
+-------------------------------------------------------------
---+
|
STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
|
+-------------------------------------------------------------
---+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> SET sql_mode='ansi';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)
mysql> SELECT @@session.sql_mode;
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
| @@session.sql_mode
|
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
| REAL_AS_FLOAT,PIPES_AS_CONCAT,ANSI_QUOTES,IGNORE_SPACE,ANSI
|
+-------------------------------------------------------------

+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
If you rerun the previous UPDATE statement, you will find
that the column has been modified, but the following
warning is generated:
mysql> SHOW WARNINGS;
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------
----+
| Level | Code | Message
|
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------
----+
| Warning | 1265 | Data truncated for column 'vchar_fld' at
row 1 |
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------
----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
If you retrieve the vchar_fld column, you will see that
the string has indeed been truncated:
mysql> SELECT vchar_fld
-> FROM string_tbl;
+--------------------------------+
| vchar_fld |
+--------------------------------+
| This is a piece of extremely l |
+--------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
As you can see, only the first 30 characters of the 46-
character string made it into the vchar_fld column. The
best way to avoid string truncation (or exceptions, in the
case of Oracle Database or MySQL in strict mode) when
working with varchar columns is to set the upper limit of
a column to a high enough value to handle the longest
strings that might be stored in the column (keeping in
mind that the server allocates only enough space to store
the string, so it is not wasteful to set a high upper limit
for varchar columns).
Including single quotes
Since strings are demarcated by single quotes, you will
need to be alert for strings that include single quotes or
apostrophes. For example, you won’t be able to insert the
following string because the server will think that the
apostrophe in the word doesn’t marks the end of the
string:

UPDATE string_tbl
SET text_fld = 'This string doesn't work';
To make the server ignore the apostrophe in the word
doesn’t, you will need to add an escape to the string so
that the server treats the apostrophe like any other
character in the string. All three servers allow you to
escape a single quote by adding another single quote
directly before, as in:
mysql> UPDATE string_tbl
-> SET text_fld = 'This string didn''t work, but it does
now';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
Note ✎
Oracle Database and MySQL users may also choose
to escape a single quote by adding a backslash
character immediately before, as in:
UPDATE string_tbl SET text_fld =
'This string didn\'t work, but it does now'
If you retrieve a string for use in a screen or report field,
you don’t need to do anything special to handle
embedded quotes:
mysql> SELECT text_fld
-> FROM string_tbl;
+------------------------------------------+
| text_fld |
+------------------------------------------+
| This string didn't work, but it does now |
+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
However, if you are retrieving the string to add to a file
that another program will read, you may want to include
the escape as part of the retrieved string. If you are
using MySQL, you can use the built-in function quote(),
which places quotes around the entire string and adds
escapes to any single quotes/apostrophes within the
string. Here’s what our string looks like when retrieved
via the quote() function:
mysql> SELECT quote(text_fld)
-> FROM string_tbl;
+---------------------------------------------+
| QUOTE(text_fld) |
+---------------------------------------------+

| 'This string didn\'t work, but it does now' |
+---------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.04 sec)
When retrieving data for data export, you may want to
use the quote() function for all non-system-generated
character columns, such as a customer_notes column.
Including special characters
If your application is multinational in scope, you might
find yourself working with strings that include characters
that do not appear on your keyboard. When working with
the French and German languages, for example, you
might need to include accented characters such as é and
ö. The SQL Server and MySQL servers include the built-
in function char() so that you can build strings from any
of the 255 characters in the ASCII character set (Oracle
Database users can use the chr() function). To
demonstrate, the next example retrieves a typed string
and its equivalent built via individual characters:
mysql> SELECT 'abcdefg', CHAR(97,98,99,100,101,102,103);
+---------+--------------------------------+
| abcdefg | CHAR(97,98,99,100,101,102,103) |
+---------+--------------------------------+
| abcdefg | abcdefg |
+---------+--------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
Thus, the 97th character in the ASCII character set is the
letter a. While the characters shown in the preceding
example are not special, the following examples show the
location of the accented characters along with other
special characters, such as currency symbols:
mysql> SELECT CHAR(128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137);
+-----------------------------------------------+
| CHAR(128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137) |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| Çüéâäàåçêë |
+-----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql> SELECT CHAR(138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147);
+-----------------------------------------------+
| CHAR(138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147) |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| èïîìÄÅÉæÆô |
+-----------------------------------------------+

1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql> SELECT CHAR(148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157);
+-----------------------------------------------+
| CHAR(148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157) |
+-----------------------------------------------+
| öòÛùÿ...Ü¢£¥ |
+-----------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> SELECT CHAR(158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165);
+---------------------------------------+
| CHAR(158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165) |
+---------------------------------------+
| fáíóúñÑ |
+---------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
Note ✎
I am using the latin1 character set for the examples
in this section. If your session is configured for a
different character set, you will see a different set of
characters than what is shown here. The same
concepts apply, but you will need to familiarize
yourself with the layout of your character set to
locate specific characters.
Building strings character by character can be quite
tedious, especially if only a few of the characters in the
string are accented. Fortunately, you can use the
concat() function to concatenate individual strings,
some of which you can type while others you can
generate via the char() function. For example, the
following shows how to build the phrase danke schön
using the concat() and char() functions:
mysql> SELECT CONCAT('danke sch', CHAR(148), 'n');
+-------------------------------------+
| CONCAT('danke sch', CHAR(148), 'n') |
+-------------------------------------+
| danke schön |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Note ✎
Oracle Database users can use the concatenation
operator (||) instead of the concat() function, as in:
SELECT 'danke sch' || CHR(148) || 'n'
FROM dual;
SQL Server does not include a concat() function, so
you will need to use the concatenation operator (+),
as in:
SELECT 'danke sch' + CHAR(148) + 'n'
If you have a character and need to find its ASCII
equivalent, you can use the ascii() function, which
takes the leftmost character in the string and returns a
number:
mysql> SELECT ASCII('ö');
+------------+
| ASCII('ö') |
+------------+
| 148 |
+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Using the char(), ascii(), and concat() functions (or
concatenation operators), you should be able to work
with any Roman language even if you are using a
keyboard that does not include accented or special
characters.
String Manipulation
Each database server includes many built-in functions for
manipulating strings. This section explores two types of
string functions: those that return numbers and those
that return strings. Before I begin, however, I reset the
data in the string_tbl table to the following:
mysql> DELETE FROM string_tbl;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl (char_fld, vchar_fld, text_fld)
-> VALUES ('This string is 28 characters',
-> 'This string is 28 characters',
-> 'This string is 28 characters');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
String functions that return numbers

Of the string functions that return numbers, one of the
most commonly used is the length() function, which
returns the number of characters in the string (SQL
Server users will need to use the len() function). The
following query applies the length() function to each
column in the string_tbl table:
mysql> SELECT LENGTH(char_fld) char_length,
-> LENGTH(vchar_fld) varchar_length,
-> LENGTH(text_fld) text_length
-> FROM string_tbl;
+-------------+----------------+-------------+
| char_length | varchar_length | text_length |
+-------------+----------------+-------------+
| 28 | 28 | 28 |
+-------------+----------------+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
While the lengths of the varchar and text columns are
as expected, you might have expected the length of the
char column to be 30, since I told you that strings stored
in char columns are right-padded with spaces. The
MySQL server removes trailing spaces from char data
when it is retrieved, however, so you will see the same
results from all string functions regardless of the type of
column in which the strings are stored.
Along with finding the length of a string, you might want
to find the location of a substring within a string. For
example, if you want to find the position at which the
string 'characters' appears in the vchar_fld column,
you could use the position() function, as demonstrated
by the following:
mysql> SELECT POSITION('characters' IN vchar_fld)
-> FROM string_tbl;
+-------------------------------------+
| POSITION('characters' IN vchar_fld) |
+-------------------------------------+
| 19 |
+-------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
If the substring cannot be found, the position()
function returns 0.

Warning ☠
For those of you who program in a language such as
C or C++, where the first element of an array is at
position 0, remember when working with databases
that the first character in a string is at position 1. A
return value of 0 from position() indicates that the
substring could not be found, not that the substring
was found at the first position in the string.
If you want to start your search at something other than
the first character of your target string, you will need to
use the locate() function, which is similar to the
position() function except that it allows an optional
third parameter, which is used to define the search’s
start position. The locate() function is also proprietary,
whereas the position() function is part of the SQL:2003
standard. Here’s an example asking for the position of
the string 'is' starting at the fifth character in the
vchar_fld column:
mysql> SELECT LOCATE('is', vchar_fld, 5)
-> FROM string_tbl;
+----------------------------+
| LOCATE('is', vchar_fld, 5) |

Note ✎
Oracle Database does not include the position() or
locate() function, but it does include the instr()
function, which mimics the position() function
when provided with two arguments and mimics the
locate() function when provided with three
arguments. SQL Server also doesn’t include a
position() or locate() function, but it does include
the charindx() function, which also accepts either
two or three arguments similar to Oracle’s instr()
function.
Another function that takes strings as arguments and
returns numbers is the string comparison function
strcmp(). Strcmp(), which is implemented only by

MySQL and has no analog in Oracle Database or SQL
Server, takes two strings as arguments, and returns one
of the following:
−1 if the first string comes before the second string
in sort order
0 if the strings are identical
1 if the first string comes after the second string in
sort order
To illustrate how the function works, I first show the sort
order of five strings using a query, and then show how
the strings compare to one another using strcmp(). Here
are the five strings that I insert into the string_tbl
table:
mysql> DELETE FROM string_tbl;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl(vchar_fld) VALUES ('abcd');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl(vchar_fld) VALUES ('xyz');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl(vchar_fld) VALUES ('QRSTUV');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl(vchar_fld) VALUES ('qrstuv');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl(vchar_fld) VALUES ('12345');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Here are the five strings in their sort order:
mysql> SELECT vchar_fld
-> FROM string_tbl
-> ORDER BY vchar_fld;
+-----------+
| vchar_fld |
+-----------+
| 12345 |
| abcd |
| QRSTUV |
| qrstuv |
| xyz |
+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The next query makes six comparisons among the five
different strings:

mysql> SELECT STRCMP('12345','12345') 12345_12345,
-> STRCMP('abcd','xyz') abcd_xyz,
-> STRCMP('abcd','QRSTUV') abcd_QRSTUV,
-> STRCMP('qrstuv','QRSTUV') qrstuv_QRSTUV,
-> STRCMP('12345','xyz') 12345_xyz,
-> STRCMP('xyz','qrstuv') xyz_qrstuv;
+-------------+----------+-------------+---------------+------
-----+------------+
| 12345_12345 | abcd_xyz | abcd_QRSTUV | qrstuv_QRSTUV |
12345_xyz | xyz_qrstuv |
+-------------+----------+-------------+---------------+------
-----+------------+
| 0 | −1 | −1 | 0 |
−1 | 1 |
+-------------+----------+-------------+---------------+------
-----+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
The first comparison yields 0, which is to be expected
since I compared a string to itself. The fourth comparison
also yields 0, which is a bit surprising, since the strings
are composed of the same letters, with one string all
uppercase and the other all lowercase. The reason for
this result is that MySQL’s strcmp() function is case-
insensitive, which is something to remember when using
the function. The other four comparisons yield either −1
or 1 depending on whether the first string comes before
or after the second string in sort order. For example,
strcmp('abcd','xyz') yields −1, since the string 'abcd'
comes before the string 'xyz'.
Along with the strcmp() function, MySQL also allows
you to use the like and regexp operators to compare
strings in the select clause. Such comparisons will yield
1 (for true) or 0 (for false). Therefore, these operators
allow you to build expressions that return a number,
much like the functions described in this section. Here’s
an example using like:
mysql> SELECT name, name LIKE '%ns' ends_in_ns
-> FROM department;
+----------------+------------+
| name | ends_in_ns |
+----------------+------------+
| Operations | 1 |
| Loans | 1 |
| Administration | 0 |

+----------------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.25 sec)
This example retrieves all the department names, along
with an expression that returns 1 if the department name
ends in “ns” or 0 otherwise. If you want to perform more
complex pattern matches, you can use the regexp
operator, as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT cust_id, cust_type_cd, fed_id,
-> fed_id REGEXP '.{3}-.{2}-.{4}' is_ss_no_format
-> FROM customer;
+---------+--------------+-------------+-----------------+
| cust_id | cust_type_cd | fed_id | is_ss_no_format |
+---------+--------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 1 | I | 111-11-1111 | 1 |
| 2 | I | 222-22-2222 | 1 |
| 3 | I | 333-33-3333 | 1 |
| 4 | I | 444-44-4444 | 1 |
| 5 | I | 555-55-5555 | 1 |
| 6 | I | 666-66-6666 | 1 |
| 7 | I | 777-77-7777 | 1 |
| 8 | I | 888-88-8888 | 1 |
| 9 | I | 999-99-9999 | 1 |
| 10 | B | 04-1111111 | 0 |
| 11 | B | 04-2222222 | 0 |
| 12 | B | 04-3333333 | 0 |
| 13 | B | 04-4444444 | 0 |
+---------+--------------+-------------+-----------------+
13 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The fourth column of this query returns 1 if the value
stored in the fed_id column matches the format for a
Social Security number.
Note ✎
SQL Server and Oracle Database users can achieve
similar results by building case expressions, which I
describe in detail in Chapter 11.
String functions that return strings
In some cases, you will need to modify existing strings,
either by extracting part of the string or by adding
additional text to the string. Every database server
includes multiple functions to help with these tasks.
Before I begin, I once again reset the data in the
string_tbl table:
mysql> DELETE FROM string_tbl;
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO string_tbl (text_fld)
-> VALUES ('This string was 29 characters');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Earlier in the chapter, I demonstrated the use of the
concat() function to help build words that include
accented characters. The concat() function is useful in
many other situations, including when you need to
append additional characters to a stored string. For
instance, the following example modifies the string
stored in the text_fld column by tacking an additional
phrase on the end:
mysql> UPDATE string_tbl
-> SET text_fld = CONCAT(text_fld, ', but now it is
longer');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.03 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
The contents of the text_fld column are now as follows:
mysql> SELECT text_fld
-> FROM string_tbl;
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| text_fld |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| This string was 29 characters, but now it is longer |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Thus, like all functions that return a string, you can use
concat() to replace the data stored in a character
column.
Another common use for the concat() function is to
build a string from individual pieces of data. For
example, the following query generates a narrative string
for each bank teller:
mysql> SELECT CONCAT(fname, ' ', lname, ' has been a ',
-> title, ' since ', start_date) emp_narrative
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller';
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| emp_narrative |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Helen Fleming has been a Head Teller since 2008-03-17 |
| Chris Tucker has been a Teller since 2008-09-15 |
| Sarah Parker has been a Teller since 2006-12-02 |
| Jane Grossman has been a Teller since 2006-05-03 |
| Paula Roberts has been a Head Teller since 2006-07-27 |
| Thomas Ziegler has been a Teller since 2004-10-23 |

| Samantha Jameson has been a Teller since 2007-01-08 |
| John Blake has been a Head Teller since 2004-05-11 |
| Cindy Mason has been a Teller since 2006-08-09 |
| Frank Portman has been a Teller since 2007-04-01 |
| Theresa Markham has been a Head Teller since 2005-03-15 |
| Beth Fowler has been a Teller since 2006-06-29 |
| Rick Tulman has been a Teller since 2006-12-12 |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
13 rows in set (0.30 sec)
The concat() function can handle any expression that
returns a string, and will even convert numbers and
dates to string format, as evidenced by the date column
(start_date) used as an argument. Although Oracle
Database includes the concat() function, it will accept
only two string arguments, so the previous query will not
work on Oracle. Instead, you would need to use the
concatenation operator (||) rather than a function call,
as in:
SELECT fname || ' ' || lname || ' has been a ' ||
title || ' since ' || start_date emp_narrative
FROM employee
WHERE title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller';
SQL Server does not include a concat() function, so you
would need to use the same approach as the previous
query, except that you would use SQL Server’s
concatenation operator (+) instead of ||.
While concat() is useful for adding characters to the
beginning or end of a string, you may also have a need to
add or replace characters in the middle of a string. All
three database servers provide functions for this
purpose, but all of them are different, so I demonstrate
the MySQL function and then show the functions from
the other two servers.
MySQL includes the insert() function, which takes four
arguments: the original string, the position at which to
start, the number of characters to replace, and the
replacement string. Depending on the value of the third
argument, the function may be used to either insert or
replace characters in a string. With a value of 0 for the
third argument, the replacement string is inserted and
any trailing characters are pushed to the right, as in:

mysql> SELECT INSERT('goodbye world', 9, 0, 'cruel ') string;
+---------------------+
| string |
+---------------------+
| goodbye cruel world |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
In this example, all characters starting from position 9
are pushed to the right and the string 'cruel' is
inserted. If the third argument is greater than zero, then
that number of characters is replaced with the
replacement string, as in:
mysql> SELECT INSERT('goodbye world', 1, 7, 'hello') string;
+-------------+
| string |
+-------------+
| hello world |
+-------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
For this example, the first seven characters are replaced
with the string 'hello'. Oracle Database does not
provide a single function with the flexibility of MySQL’s
insert() function, but Oracle does provide the
replace() function, which is useful for replacing one
substring with another. Here’s the previous example
reworked to use replace():
SELECT REPLACE('goodbye world', 'goodbye', 'hello')
FROM dual;
All instances of the string 'goodbye' will be replaced
with the string 'hello', resulting in the string 'hello
world'. The replace() function will replace every
instance of the search string with the replacement string,
so you need to be careful that you don’t end up with
more replacements than you anticipated.
SQL Server also includes a replace() function with the
same functionality as Oracle’s, but SQL Server also
includes a function called stuff() with similar
functionality to MySQL’s insert() function. Here’s an
example:
SELECT STUFF('hello world', 1, 5, 'goodbye cruel')
When executed, five characters are removed starting at
position 1, and then the string 'goodbye cruel' is

inserted at the starting position, resulting in the string
'goodbye cruel world'.
Along with inserting characters into a string, you may
have a need to extract a substring from a string. For this
purpose, all three servers include the substring()
function (although Oracle Database’s version is called
substr()), which extracts a specified number of
characters starting at a specified position. The following
example extracts five characters from a string starting at
the ninth position:
mysql> SELECT SUBSTRING('goodbye cruel world', 9, 5);
+----------------------------------------+
| SUBSTRING('goodbye cruel world', 9, 5) |
+----------------------------------------+
| cruel |
+----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Along with the functions demonstrated here, all three
servers include many more built-in functions for
manipulating string data. While many of them are
designed for very specific purposes, such as generating
the string equivalent of octal or hexadecimal numbers,
there are many other general-purpose functions as well,
such as functions that remove or add trailing spaces. For
more information, consult your server’s SQL reference
guide, or a general-purpose SQL reference guide such as
SQL in a Nutshell (O’Reilly).

Working with Numeric Data
Unlike string data (and temporal data, as you will see
shortly), numeric data generation is quite
straightforward. You can type a number, retrieve it from
another column, or generate it via a calculation. All the
usual arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) are available for
performing calculations, and parentheses may be used to
dictate precedence, as in:
mysql> SELECT (37 * 59) / (78 - (8 * 6));
+----------------------------+
| (37 * 59) / (78 - (8 * 6)) |
+----------------------------+
| 72.77 |
+----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
As I mentioned in Chapter 2, the main concern when
storing numeric data is that numbers might be rounded if
they are larger than the specified size for a numeric
column. For example, the number 9.96 will be rounded to
10.0 if stored in a column defined as float(3,1).
Performing Arithmetic Functions
Most of the built-in numeric functions are used for
specific arithmetic purposes, such as determining the
square root of a number. Table 7-1 lists some of the
common numeric functions that take a single numeric
argument and return a number.
Table 7-1. Single-argument numeric functions
Function name Description
Acos( x ) Calculates the arc cosine of x
Asin( x ) Calculates the arc sine of x
Atan( x ) Calculates the arc tangent of x
Cos( x ) Calculates the cosine of x
Cot( x ) Calculates the cotangent of x
Exp( x ) Calculates ex
Ln( x ) Calculates the natural log of x
Sin( x ) Calculates the sine of x
Sqrt( x ) Calculates the square root of x
Tan( x ) Calculates the tangent of x

These functions perform very specific tasks, and I refrain
from showing examples for these functions (if you don’t
recognize a function by name or description, then you
probably don’t need it). Other numeric functions used for
calculations, however, are a bit more flexible and deserve
some explanation.
For example, the modulo operator, which calculates the
remainder when one number is divided into another
number, is implemented in MySQL and Oracle Database
via the mod() function. The following example calculates
the remainder when 4 is divided into 10:
mysql> SELECT MOD(10,4);
+-----------+
| MOD(10,4) |
+-----------+
| 2 |
+-----------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
While the mod() function is typically used with integer
arguments, with MySQL you can also use real numbers,
as in:
mysql> SELECT MOD(22.75, 5);
+---------------+
| MOD(22.75, 5) |
+---------------+
| 2.75 |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
Note ✎
SQL Server does not have a mod() function. Instead,
the operator % is used for finding remainders. The
expression 10 % 4 will therefore yield the value 2.
Another numeric function that takes two numeric
arguments is the pow() function (or power() if you are
using Oracle Database or SQL Server), which returns one
number raised to the power of a second number, as in:
mysql> SELECT POW(2,8);
+----------+
| POW(2,8) |
+----------+
| 256 |
+----------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)

Thus, pow(2,8) is the MySQL equivalent of specifying 28.
Since computer memory is allocated in chunks of 2x
bytes, the pow() function can be a handy way to
determine the exact number of bytes in a certain amount
of memory:
mysql> SELECT POW(2,10) kilobyte, POW(2,20) megabyte,
-> POW(2,30) gigabyte, POW(2,40) terabyte;
+----------+----------+------------+---------------+
| kilobyte | megabyte | gigabyte | terabyte |
+----------+----------+------------+---------------+
| 1024 | 1048576 | 1073741824 | 1099511627776 |
+----------+----------+------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
I don’t know about you, but I find it easier to remember
that a gigabyte is 230 bytes than to remember the
number 1,073,741,824.
Controlling Number Precision
When working with floating-point numbers, you may not
always want to interact with or display a number with its
full precision. For example, you may store monetary
transaction data with a precision to six decimal places,
but you might want to round to the nearest hundredth for
display purposes. Four functions are useful when limiting
the precision of floating-point numbers: ceil(), floor(),
round(), and truncate(). All three servers include these
functions, although Oracle Database includes trunc()
instead of truncate(), and SQL Server includes
ceiling() instead of ceil().
The ceil() and floor() functions are used to round
either up or down to the closest integer, as demonstrated
by the following:
mysql> SELECT CEIL(72.445), FLOOR(72.445);
+--------------+---------------+
| CEIL(72.445) | FLOOR(72.445) |
+--------------+---------------+
| 73 | 72 |
+--------------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
Thus, any number between 72 and 73 will be evaluated
as 73 by the ceil() function and 72 by the floor()
function. Remember that ceil() will round up even if

the decimal portion of a number is very small, and
floor() will round down even if the decimal portion is
quite significant, as in:
mysql> SELECT CEIL(72.000000001), FLOOR(72.999999999);
+--------------------+---------------------+
| CEIL(72.000000001) | FLOOR(72.999999999) |
+--------------------+---------------------+
| 73 | 72 |
+--------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
If this is a bit too severe for your application, you can use
the round() function to round up or down from the
midpoint between two integers, as in:
mysql> SELECT ROUND(72.49999), ROUND(72.5), ROUND(72.50001);
+-----------------+-------------+-----------------+
| ROUND(72.49999) | ROUND(72.5) | ROUND(72.50001) |
+-----------------+-------------+-----------------+
| 72 | 73 | 73 |
+-----------------+-------------+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Using round(), any number whose decimal portion is
halfway or more between two integers will be rounded
up, whereas the number will be rounded down if the
decimal portion is anything less than halfway between
the two integers.
Most of the time, you will want to keep at least some part
of the decimal portion of a number rather than rounding
to the nearest integer; the round() function allows an
optional second argument to specify how many digits to
the right of the decimal place to round to. The next
example shows how you can use the second argument to
round the number 72.0909 to one, two, and three
decimal places:
mysql> SELECT ROUND(72.0909, 1), ROUND(72.0909, 2),
ROUND(72.0909, 3);
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| ROUND(72.0909, 1) | ROUND(72.0909, 2) | ROUND(72.0909, 3) |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
| 72.1 | 72.09 | 72.091 |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Like the round() function, the truncate() function
allows an optional second argument to specify the
number of digits to the right of the decimal, but

truncate() simply discards the unwanted digits without
rounding. The next example shows how the number
72.0909 would be truncated to one, two, and three
decimal places:
mysql> SELECT TRUNCATE(72.0909, 1), TRUNCATE(72.0909, 2),
-> TRUNCATE(72.0909, 3);
+----------------------+----------------------+---------------
-------+
| TRUNCATE(72.0909, 1) | TRUNCATE(72.0909, 2) |
TRUNCATE(72.0909, 3) |
+----------------------+----------------------+---------------
-------+
| 72.0 | 72.09 |
72.090 |
+----------------------+----------------------+---------------
-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Note ✎
SQL Server does not include a truncate() function.
Instead, the round() function allows for an optional
third argument which, if present and nonzero, calls
for the number to be truncated rather than rounded.
Both truncate() and round() also allow a negative
value for the second argument, meaning that numbers to
the left of the decimal place are truncated or rounded.
This might seem like a strange thing to do at first, but
there are valid applications. For example, you might sell
a product that can be purchased only in units of 10. If a
customer were to order 17 units, you could choose from
one of the following methods to modify the customer’s
order quantity:
mysql> SELECT ROUND(17, −1), TRUNCATE(17, −1);
+---------------+------------------+
| ROUND(17, −1) | TRUNCATE(17, −1) |
+---------------+------------------+
| 20 | 10 |
+---------------+------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
If the product in question is thumbtacks, then it might
not make much difference to your bottom line whether
you sold the customer 10 or 20 thumbtacks when only 17
were requested; if you are selling Rolex watches,
however, your business may fare better by rounding.

Handling Signed Data
If you are working with numeric columns that allow
negative values (in Chapter 2, I showed how a numeric
column may be labeled unsigned, meaning that only
positive numbers are allowed), several numeric functions
might be of use. Let’s say, for example, that you are
asked to generate a report showing the current status of
each bank account. The following query returns three
columns useful for generating the report:
mysql> SELECT account_id, SIGN(avail_balance),
ABS(avail_balance)
-> FROM account;
+------------+---------------------+--------------------+
| account_id | SIGN(avail_balance) | ABS(avail_balance) |
+------------+---------------------+--------------------+
| 1 | 1 | 1057.75 |
| 2 | 1 | 500.00 |
| 3 | 1 | 3000.00 |
| 4 | 1 | 2258.02 |
| 5 | 1 | 200.00 |
| ... |
| 19 | 1 | 1500.00 |
| 20 | 1 | 23575.12 |
| 21 | 0 | 0.00 |
| 22 | 1 | 9345.55 |
| 23 | 1 | 38552.05 |
| 24 | 1 | 50000.00 |
+------------+---------------------+--------------------+
24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The second column uses the sign() function to return −1
if the account balance is negative, 0 if the account
balance is zero, and 1 if the account balance is positive.
The third column returns the absolute value of the
account balance via the abs() function.

Working with Temporal Data
Of the three types of data discussed in this chapter
(character, numeric, and temporal), temporal data is the
most involved when it comes to data generation and
manipulation. Some of the complexity of temporal data is
caused by the myriad ways in which a single date and
time can be described. For example, the date on which I
wrote this paragraph can be described in all the
following ways:
Wednesday, September 17, 2008
9/17/2008 2:14:56 P.M. EST
9/17/2008 19:14:56 GMT
2612008 (Julian format)
Star date [−4] 85712.03 14:14:56 (Star Trek format)
While some of these differences are purely a matter of
formatting, most of the complexity has to do with your
frame of reference, which we explore in the next section.
Dealing with Time Zones
Because people around the world prefer that noon
coincides roughly with the sun’s peak at their location,
there has never been a serious attempt to coerce
everyone to use a universal clock. Instead, the world has
been sliced into 24 imaginary sections, called time zones;
within a particular time zone, everyone agrees on the
current time, whereas people in different time zones do
not. While this seems simple enough, some geographic
regions shift their time by one hour twice a year
(implementing what is known as daylight saving time)
and some do not, so the time difference between two
points on Earth might be four hours for one half of the
year and five hours for the other half of the year. Even
within a single time zone, different regions may or may
not adhere to daylight saving time, causing different
clocks in the same time zone to agree for one half of the
year but be one hour different for the rest of the year.
While the computer age has exacerbated the issue,
people have been dealing with time zone differences
since the early days of naval exploration. To ensure a

common point of reference for timekeeping, fifteenth-
century navigators set their clocks to the time of day in
Greenwich, England. This became known as Greenwich
Mean Time, or GMT. All other time zones can be
described by the number of hours’ difference from GMT;
for example, the time zone for the Eastern United States,
known as Eastern Standard Time, can be described as
GMT −5:00, or five hours earlier than GMT.
Today, we use a variation of GMT called Coordinated
Universal Time, or UTC, which is based on an atomic
clock (or, to be more precise, the average time of 200
atomic clocks in 50 locations worldwide, which is
referred to as Universal Time). Both SQL Server and
MySQL provide functions that will return the current
UTC timestamp (getutcdate() for SQL Server and
utc_timestamp() for MySQL).
Most database servers default to the time zone setting of
the server on which it resides and provide tools for
modifying the time zone if needed. For example, a
database used to store stock exchange transactions from
around the world would generally be configured to use
UTC time, whereas a database used to store transactions
at a particular retail establishment might use the
server’s time zone.
MySQL keeps two different time zone settings: a global
time zone, and a session time zone, which may be
different for each user logged in to a database. You can
see both settings via the following query:
mysql> SELECT @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;
+--------------------+---------------------+
| @@global.time_zone | @@session.time_zone |
+--------------------+---------------------+
| SYSTEM | SYSTEM |
+--------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
A value of system tells you that the server is using the
time zone setting from the server on which the database
resides.
If you are sitting at a computer in Zurich, Switzerland,
and you open a session across the network to a MySQL

server situated in New York, you may want to change the
time zone setting for your session, which you can do via
the following command:
mysql> SET time_zone = 'Europe/Zurich';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.18 sec)
If you check the time zone settings again, you will see
the following:
mysql> SELECT @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;
+--------------------+---------------------+
| @@global.time_zone | @@session.time_zone |
+--------------------+---------------------+
| SYSTEM | Europe/Zurich |
+--------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
All dates displayed in your session will now conform to
Zurich time.
Note ✎
Oracle Database users can change the time zone
setting for a session via the following command:
ALTER SESSION TIMEZONE = 'Europe/Zurich'
Generating Temporal Data
You can generate temporal data via any of the following
means:
Copying data from an existing date, datetime, or
time column
Executing a built-in function that returns a date,
datetime, or time
Building a string representation of the temporal data
to be evaluated by the server
To use the last method, you will need to understand the
various components used in formatting dates.
String representations of temporal data
Table 2-5 in Chapter 2 presented the more popular date
components; to refresh your memory, Table 7-2 shows
these same components.
Loading MySQL Time Zone Data
If you are running the MySQL server on a Windows
platform, you will need to load time zone data manually

before you can set global or session time zones. To do
so, you need to follow these steps:
1. Download the time zone data from
http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/timezones.html.
2. Shut down your MySQL server.
3. Extract the files from the downloaded ZIP file (in
my case, the file was called timezone-2006p.zip)
and place them in your MySQL installation
directory under /data/mysql (the full path for my
installation was /Program Files/MySQL/MySQL
Server 6.0/data/mysql).
4. Restart your MySQL server.
To look at the time zone data, change to the mysql
database via the use mysql command, and execute
the following query:
mysql> SELECT name FROM time_zone_name;
+----------------------------------+
| name |
+----------------------------------+

To change your time zone setting, choose one of the
names from the previous query that best matches
your location.
Table 7-2. Date format components
| Component | Definition              | Range                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| YYYY      | Year, including century | 1000 to 9999                  |
| MM        | Month                   | 01 (January) to 12 (December) |
| DD        | Day                     | 01 to 31                      |
| HH        | Hour                    | 00 to 23                      |
| HHH       | Hours (elapsed)         | −838 to 838                   |
| MI        | Minute                  | 00 to 59                      |
| SS        | Second                  | 00 to 59                      |
To build a string that the server can interpret as a date,
datetime, or time, you need to put the various
components together in the order shown in Table 7-3.
Table 7-3. Required date components
| Type      | Default format      |     |
| --------- | ------------------- | --- |
| Date      | YYYY-MM-DD          |     |
| Datetime  | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS |     |
| Timestamp | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS |     |
| Time      | HHH:MI:SS           |     |
Thus, to populate a datetime column with 3:30 P.M. on
September 17, 2008, you will need to build the following
string:
'2008-09-17 15:30:00'
If the server is expecting a datetime value, such as when
updating a datetime column or when calling a built-in
function that takes a datetime argument, you can
provide a properly formatted string with the required
date components, and the server will do the conversion
for you. For example, here’s a statement used to modify
the date of a bank transaction:
UPDATE transaction
SET txn_date = '2008-09-17 15:30:00'
WHERE txn_id = 99999;

The server determines that the string provided in the set
clause must be a datetime value, since the string is
being used to populate a datetime column. Therefore,
the server will attempt to convert the string for you by
parsing the string into the six components (year, month,
day, hour, minute, second) included in the default
datetime format.
String-to-date conversions
If the server is not expecting a datetime value, or if you
would like to represent the datetime using a nondefault
format, you will need to tell the server to convert the
string to a datetime. For example, here is a simple query
that returns a datetime value using the cast() function:
mysql> SELECT CAST('2008-09-17 15:30:00' AS DATETIME);
+-----------------------------------------+
| CAST('2008-09-17 15:30:00' AS DATETIME) |
+-----------------------------------------+
| 2008-09-17 15:30:00 |
+-----------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
We cover the cast() function at the end of this chapter.
While this example demonstrates how to build datetime
values, the same logic applies to the date and time types
as well. The following query uses the cast() function to
generate a date value and a time value:
mysql> SELECT CAST('2008-09-17' AS DATE) date_field,
-> CAST('108:17:57' AS TIME) time_field;
+------------+------------+
| date_field | time_field |
+------------+------------+
| 2008-09-17 | 108:17:57 |
+------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
You may, of course, explicitly convert your strings even
when the server is expecting a date, datetime, or time
value, rather than letting the server do an implicit
conversion.
When strings are converted to temporal values—whether
explicitly or implicitly—you must provide all the date
components in the required order. While some servers
are quite strict regarding the date format, the MySQL
server is quite lenient about the separators used between

the components. For example, MySQL will accept all of
the following strings as valid representations of 3:30 P.M.
on September 17, 2008:
'2008-09-17 15:30:00'
'2008/09/17 15:30:00'
'2008,09,17,15,30,00'
'20080917153000'
Although this gives you a bit more flexibility, you may
find yourself trying to generate a temporal value without
the default date components; the next section
demonstrates a built-in function that is far more flexible
than the cast() function.
Functions for generating dates
If you need to generate temporal data from a string, and
the string is not in the proper form to use the cast()
function, you can use a built-in function that allows you
to provide a format string along with the date string.
MySQL includes the str_to_date() function for this
purpose. Say, for example, that you pull the string
'September 17, 2008' from a file and need to use it to
update a date column. Since the string is not in the
required YYYY-MM-DD format, you can use
str_to_date() instead of reformatting the string so that
you can use the cast() function, as in:
UPDATE individual
SET birth_date = STR_TO_DATE('September 17, 2008', '%M %d,
%Y')
WHERE cust_id = 9999;
The second argument in the call to str_to_date()
defines the format of the date string, with, in this case, a
month name (%M), a numeric day (%d), and a four-digit
numeric year (%Y). While there are over 30 recognized
format components, Table 7-4 defines the dozen or so
most commonly used components.
Table 7-4. Date format components
Format component Description
%M Month name (January to December)
%m Month numeric (01 to 12)
%d Day numeric (01 to 31)
%j Day of year (001 to 366)

Format component Description
%W Weekday name (Sunday to Saturday)
%Y Year, four-digit numeric
%y Year, two-digit numeric
%H Hour (00 to 23)
%h Hour (01 to 12)
%i Minutes (00 to 59)
%s Seconds (00 to 59)
%f Microseconds (000000 to 999999)
%p A.M. or P.M.
The str_to_date() function returns a datetime, date,
or time value depending on the contents of the format
string. For example, if the format string includes only %H,
%i, and %s, then a time value will be returned.
Note ✎
Oracle Database users can use the to_date()
function in the same manner as MySQL’s
str_to_date() function. SQL Server includes a
convert() function that is not quite as flexible as
MySQL and Oracle Database; rather than supplying a
custom format string, your date string must conform
to one of 21 predefined formats.
If you are trying to generate the current date/time, then
you won’t need to build a string, because the following
built-in functions will access the system clock and return
the current date and/or time as a string for you:
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_DATE(), CURRENT_TIME(),
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
| CURRENT_DATE() | CURRENT_TIME() | CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() |
+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
| 2008-09-18 | 19:53:12 | 2008-09-18 19:53:12 |
+----------------+----------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)
The values returned by these functions are in the default
format for the temporal type being returned. Oracle
Database includes current_date() and
current_timestamp() but not current_time(), and SQL
Server includes only the current_timestamp() function.

Manipulating Temporal Data
This section explores the built-in functions that take date
arguments and return dates, strings, or numbers.
Temporal functions that return dates
Many of the built-in temporal functions take one date as
an argument and return another date. MySQL’s
date_add() function, for example, allows you to add any
kind of interval (e.g., days, months, years) to a specified
date to generate another date. Here’s an example that
demonstrates how to add five days to the current date:
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 5 DAY);
+------------------------------------------+
| DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 5 DAY) |
+------------------------------------------+
| 2008-09-22 |
+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.06 sec)
The second argument is composed of three elements: the
interval keyword, the desired quantity, and the type of
interval. Table 7-5 shows some of the commonly used
interval types.
Table 7-5. Common interval types
Interval name Description
Second Number of seconds
Minute Number of minutes
Hour Number of hours
Day Number of days
Month Number of months
Year Number of years
Minute_second Number of minutes and seconds, separated by “:”
Hour_second Number of hours, minutes, and seconds, separated by “:”
Year_month Number of years and months, separated by “-”
While the first six types listed in Table 7-5 are pretty
straightforward, the last three types require a bit more
explanation since they have multiple elements. For
example, if you are told that transaction ID 9999 actually
occurred 3 hours, 27 minutes, and 11 seconds later than
what was posted to the transaction table, you can fix it
via the following:

UPDATE transaction
SET txn_date = DATE_ADD(txn_date, INTERVAL '3:27:11'
HOUR_SECOND)
WHERE txn_id = 9999;
In this example, the date_add() function takes the value
in the txn_date column, adds 3 hours, 27 minutes, and
11 seconds to it, and uses the value that results to modify
the txn_date column.
Or, if you work in HR and found out that employee ID
4789 claimed to be younger than he actually is, you could
add 9 years and 11 months to his birth date, as in:
UPDATE employee
SET birth_date = DATE_ADD(birth_date, INTERVAL '9-11'
YEAR_MONTH)
WHERE emp_id = 4789;
Note ✎
SQL Server users can accomplish the previous
example using the dateadd() function:
UPDATE employee
SET birth_date =
DATEADD(MONTH, 119, birth_date)
WHERE emp_id = 4789
SQL Server doesn’t have combined intervals (i.e.,
year_month), so I converted 9 years, 11 months to
119 months.
Oracle Database users can use the add_months()
function for this example, as in:
UPDATE employee
SET birth_date = ADD_MONTHS(birth_date, 119)
WHERE emp_id = 4789;
There are some cases where you want to add an interval
to a date, and you know where you want to arrive but not
how many days it takes to get there. For example, let’s
say that a bank customer logs on to the online banking
system and schedules a transfer for the end of the
month. Rather than writing some code that figures out
what month you are currently in and looks up the
number of days in that month, you can call the
last_day() function, which does the work for you (both
MySQL and Oracle Database include the last_day()

function; SQL Server has no comparable function). If the
customer asks for the transfer on September 17, 2008,
you could find the last day of September via the
following:
mysql> SELECT LAST_DAY('2008-09-17');
+------------------------+
| LAST_DAY('2008-09-17') |
+------------------------+
| 2008-09-30 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set (0.10 sec)
Whether you provide a date or datetime value, the
last_day() function always returns a date. Although
this function may not seem like an enormous timesaver,
the underlying logic can be tricky if you’re trying to find
the last day of February and need to figure out whether
the current year is a leap year.
Another temporal function that returns a date is one that
converts a datetime value from one time zone to another.
For this purpose, MySQL includes the convert_tz()
function and Oracle Database includes the new_time()
function. If I want to convert my current local time to
UTC, for example, I could do the following:
mysql> SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() current_est,
-> CONVERT_TZ(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), 'US/Eastern', 'UTC')
current_utc;
+---------------------+---------------------+
| current_est | current_utc |
+---------------------+---------------------+
| 2008-09-18 20:01:25 | 2008-09-19 00:01:25 |
+---------------------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.76 sec)
This function comes in handy when receiving dates in a
different time zone than what is stored in your database.
Temporal functions that return strings
Most of the temporal functions that return string values
are used to extract a portion of a date or time. For
example, MySQL includes the dayname() function to
determine which day of the week a certain date falls on,
as in:
mysql> SELECT DAYNAME('2008-09-18');
+-----------------------+
| DAYNAME('2008-09-18') |

+-----------------------+
| Thursday |
+-----------------------+
1 row in set (0.08 sec)
Many such functions are included with MySQL for
extracting information from date values, but I
recommend that you use the extract() function instead,
since it’s easier to remember a few variations of one
function than to remember a dozen different functions.
Additionally, the extract() function is part of the
SQL:2003 standard and has been implemented by Oracle
Database as well as MySQL.
The extract() function uses the same interval types as
the date_add() function (see Table 7-5) to define which
element of the date interests you. For example, if you
want to extract just the year portion of a datetime value,
you can do the following:
mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2008-09-18 22:19:05');
+------------------------------------------+
| EXTRACT(YEAR FROM '2008-09-18 22:19:05') |
+------------------------------------------+
| 2008 |
+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Note ✎
SQL Server doesn’t include an implementation of
extract(), but it does include the datepart()
function. Here’s how you would extract the year from
a datetime value using datepart():
SELECT DATEPART(YEAR, GETDATE())
Temporal functions that return numbers
Earlier in this chapter, I showed you a function used to
add a given interval to a date value, thus generating
another date value. Another common activity when
working with dates is to take two date values and
determine the number of intervals (days, weeks, years)
between the two dates. For this purpose, MySQL
includes the function datediff(), which returns the
number of full days between two dates. For example, if I

want to know the number of days that my kids will be out
of school this summer, I can do the following:
mysql> SELECT DATEDIFF('2009-09-03', '2009-06-24');
+--------------------------------------+
| DATEDIFF('2009-09-03', '2009-06-24') |
+--------------------------------------+
| 71 |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
Thus, I will have to endure 71 days of poison ivy,
mosquito bites, and scraped knees before the kids are
safely back at school. The datediff() function ignores
the time of day in its arguments. Even if I include a time-
of-day, setting it to one second until midnight for the first
date and to one second after midnight for the second
date, those times will have no effect on the calculation:
mysql> SELECT DATEDIFF('2009-09-03 23:59:59', '2009-06-24
00:00:01');
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| DATEDIFF('2009-09-03 23:59:59', '2009-06-24 00:00:01') |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 71 |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
If I switch the arguments and have the earlier date first,
datediff() will return a negative number, as in:
mysql> SELECT DATEDIFF('2009-06-24', '2009-09-03');
+--------------------------------------+
| DATEDIFF('2009-06-24', '2009-09-03') |
+--------------------------------------+
| −71 |
+--------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

Note ✎
SQL Server also includes the datediff() function,
but it is more flexible than the MySQL
implementation in that you can specify the interval
type (i.e., year, month, day, hour) instead of counting
only the number of days between two dates. Here’s
how SQL Server would accomplish the previous
example:
SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, '2009-06-24', '2009-09-03')
Oracle Database allows you to determine the number
of days between two dates simply by subtracting one
date from another.

Conversion Functions
Earlier in this chapter, I showed you how to use the
cast() function to convert a string to a datetime value.
While every database server includes a number of
proprietary functions used to convert data from one type
to another, I recommend using the cast() function,
which is included in the SQL:2003 standard and has been
implemented by MySQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft
SQL Server.
To use cast(), you provide a value or expression, the as
keyword, and the type to which you want the value
converted. Here’s an example that converts a string to an
integer:
mysql> SELECT CAST('1456328' AS SIGNED INTEGER);
+-----------------------------------+
| CAST('1456328' AS SIGNED INTEGER) |
+-----------------------------------+
| 1456328 |
+-----------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
When converting a string to a number, the cast()
function will attempt to convert the entire string from
left to right; if any non-numeric characters are found in
the string, the conversion halts without an error.
Consider the following example:
mysql> SELECT CAST('999ABC111' AS UNSIGNED INTEGER);
+---------------------------------------+
| CAST('999ABC111' AS UNSIGNED INTEGER) |
+---------------------------------------+
| 999 |
+---------------------------------------+
1 row in set, 1 warning (0.08 sec)
mysql> show warnings;
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------
----+
| Level | Code | Message
|
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------
----+
| Warning | 1292 | Truncated incorrect INTEGER value:
'999ABC111' |
+---------+------+--------------------------------------------
----+
1 row in set (0.07 sec)

In this case, the first three digits of the string are
converted, whereas the rest of the string is discarded,
resulting in a value of 999. The server did, however, issue
a warning to let you know that not all the string was
converted.
If you are converting a string to a date, time, or
datetime value, then you will need to stick with the
default formats for each type, since you can’t provide the
cast() function with a format string. If your date string
is not in the default format (i.e., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
for datetime types), then you will need to resort to using
another function, such as MySQL’s str_to_date()
function described earlier in the chapter.

Chapter 8. Grouping and Aggregates
Data is generally stored at the lowest level of granularity
needed by any of a database’s users; if Chuck in
accounting needs to look at individual customer
transactions, then there needs to be a table in the
database that stores individual transactions. That doesn’t
mean, however, that all users must deal with the data as
it is stored in the database. The focus of this chapter is
on how data can be grouped and aggregated to allow
users to interact with it at some higher level of
granularity than what is stored in the database.
Grouping Concepts
Sometimes you will want to find trends in your data that
will require the database server to cook the data a bit
before you can generate the results you are looking for.
For example, let’s say that you are in charge of
operations at the bank, and you would like to find out
how many accounts are being opened by each bank
teller. You could issue a simple query to look at the raw
data:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id
-> FROM account;
+-------------+
| open_emp_id |
+-------------+
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 10 |
| 13 |
| 13 |
| 13 |
| 16 |

| 16 |
| 16 |
| 16 |
| 16 |
| 16 |
+-------------+
24 rows in set (0.01 sec)
With only 24 rows in the account table, it is relatively
easy to see that four different employees opened
accounts and that employee ID 16 has opened six
accounts; however, if the bank has dozens of employees
and thousands of accounts, this approach would prove
tedious and error-prone.
Instead, you can ask the database server to group the
data for you by using the group by clause. Here’s the
same query but employing a group by clause to group
the account data by employee ID:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id;
+-------------+
| open_emp_id |
+-------------+
| 1 |
| 10 |
| 13 |
| 16 |
+-------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The result set contains one row for each distinct value in
the open_emp_id column, resulting in four rows instead
of the full 24 rows. The reason for the smaller result set
is that each of the four employees opened more than one
account. To see how many accounts each teller opened,
you can use an aggregate function in the select clause
to count the number of rows in each group:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 1 | 8 |
| 10 | 7 |
| 13 | 3 |
| 16 | 6 |

+-------------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The aggregate function count() counts the number of
rows in each group, and the asterisk tells the server to
count everything in the group. Using the combination of
a group by clause and the count() aggregate function,
you are able to generate exactly the data needed to
answer the business question without having to look at
the raw data.
When grouping data, you may need to filter out
undesired data from your result set based on groups of
data rather than based on the raw data. Since the group
by clause runs after the where clause has been evaluated,
you cannot add filter conditions to your where clause for
this purpose. For example, here’s an attempt to filter out
any cases where an employee has opened fewer than five
accounts:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> WHERE COUNT(*) > 4
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id;
ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function
You cannot refer to the aggregate function count(*) in
your where clause, because the groups have not yet been
generated at the time the where clause is evaluated.
Instead, you must put your group filter conditions in the
having clause. Here’s what the query would look like
using having:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> HAVING COUNT(*) > 4;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 1 | 8 |
| 10 | 7 |
| 16 | 6 |
+-------------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Because those groups containing fewer than five
members have been filtered out via the having clause,
the result set now contains only those employees who

have opened five or more accounts, thus eliminating
employee ID 13 from the results.

Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions perform a specific operation over all
rows in a group. Although every database server has its
own set of specialty aggregate functions, the common
aggregate functions implemented by all major servers
include:
Max()
Returns the maximum value within a set
Min()
Returns the minimum value within a set
Avg()
Returns the average value across a set
Sum()
Returns the sum of the values across a set
Count()
Returns the number of values in a set
Here’s a query that uses all of the common aggregate
functions to analyze the available balances for all
checking accounts:
mysql> SELECT MAX(avail_balance) max_balance,
-> MIN(avail_balance) min_balance,
-> AVG(avail_balance) avg_balance,
-> SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance,
-> COUNT(*) num_accounts
-> FROM account
-> WHERE product_cd = 'CHK';
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----
---------+
| max_balance | min_balance | avg_balance | tot_balance |
num_accounts |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----
---------+
| 38552.05 | 122.37 | 7300.800985 | 73008.01 |
10 |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-----
---------+
1 row in set (0.09 sec)
The results from this query tell you that, across the 10
checking accounts in the account table, there is a
maximum balance of $38,552.05, a minimum balance of
$122.37, an average balance of $7,300.80, and a total
balance across all 10 accounts of $73,008.01. Hopefully,

this gives you an appreciation for the role of these
aggregate functions; the next subsections further clarify
how you can utilize these functions.
Implicit Versus Explicit Groups
In the previous example, every value returned by the
query is generated by an aggregate function, and the
aggregate functions are applied across the group of rows
specified by the filter condition product_cd = 'CHK'.
Since there is no group by clause, there is a single,
implicit group (all rows returned by the query).
In most cases, however, you will want to retrieve
additional columns along with columns generated by
aggregate functions. What if, for example, you wanted to
extend the previous query to execute the same five
aggregate functions for each product type, instead of just
for checking accounts? For this query, you would want to
retrieve the product_cd column along with the five
aggregate functions, as in:
SELECT product_cd,
MAX(avail_balance) max_balance,
MIN(avail_balance) min_balance,
AVG(avail_balance) avg_balance,
SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance,
COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM account;
However, if you try to execute the query, you will receive
the following error:
ERROR 1140 (42000): Mixing of GROUP columns
(MIN(),MAX(),COUNT(),...) with no GROUP
columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
While it may be obvious to you that you want the
aggregate functions applied to each set of products
found in the account table, this query fails because you
have not explicitly specified how the data should be
grouped. Therefore, you will need to add a group by
clause to specify over which group of rows the aggregate
functions should be applied:
mysql> SELECT product_cd,
-> MAX(avail_balance) max_balance,
-> MIN(avail_balance) min_balance,
-> AVG(avail_balance) avg_balance,
-> SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance,

-> COUNT(*) num_accts
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY product_cd;
+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-----
--------+-----------+
| product_cd | max_balance | min_balance | avg_balance |
tot_balance | num_accts |
+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-----
--------+-----------+
| BUS | 9345.55 | 0.00 | 4672.774902 |
9345.55 | 2 |
| CD | 10000.00 | 1500.00 | 4875.000000 |
19500.00 | 4 |
| CHK | 38552.05 | 122.37 | 7300.800985 |
73008.01 | 10 |
| MM | 9345.55 | 2212.50 | 5681.713216 |
17045.14 | 3 |
| SAV | 767.77 | 200.00 | 463.940002 |
1855.76 | 4 |
| SBL | 50000.00 | 50000.00 | 50000.000000 |
50000.00 | 1 |
+------------+-------------+-------------+--------------+-----
--------+-----------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
With the inclusion of the group by clause, the server
knows to group together rows having the same value in
the product_cd column first and then to apply the five
aggregate functions to each of the six groups.
Counting Distinct Values
When using the count() function to determine the
number of members in each group, you have your choice
of counting all members in the group, or counting only
the distinct values for a column across all members of
the group. For example, consider the following data,
which shows the employee responsible for opening each
account:
mysql> SELECT account_id, open_emp_id
-> FROM account
-> ORDER BY open_emp_id;
+------------+-------------+
| account_id | open_emp_id |
+------------+-------------+
| 8 | 1 |
| 9 | 1 |
| 10 | 1 |
| 12 | 1 |
| 13 | 1 |

| 17 | 1 |
| 18 | 1 |
| 19 | 1 |
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 10 |
| 3 | 10 |
| 4 | 10 |
| 5 | 10 |
| 14 | 10 |
| 22 | 10 |
| 6 | 13 |
| 7 | 13 |
| 24 | 13 |
| 11 | 16 |
| 15 | 16 |
| 16 | 16 |
| 20 | 16 |
| 21 | 16 |
| 23 | 16 |
+------------+-------------+
24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
As you can see, multiple accounts were opened by four
different employees (employee IDs 1, 10, 13, and 16).
Let’s say that, instead of performing a manual count, you
want to create a query that counts the number of
employees who have opened accounts. If you apply the
count() function to the open_emp_id column, you will
see the following results:
mysql> SELECT COUNT(open_emp_id)
-> FROM account;
+--------------------+
| COUNT(open_emp_id) |
+--------------------+
| 24 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
In this case, specifying the open_emp_id column as the
column to be counted generates the same results as
specifying count(*). If you want to count distinct values
in the group rather than just counting the number of
rows in the group, you need to specify the distinct
keyword, as in:
mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT open_emp_id)
-> FROM account;
+-----------------------------+
| COUNT(DISTINCT open_emp_id) |
+-----------------------------+

| 4 |
+-----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
By specifying distinct, therefore, the count() function
examines the values of a column for each member of the
group in order to find and remove duplicates, rather than
simply counting the number of values in the group.
Using Expressions
Along with using columns as arguments to aggregate
functions, you can build expressions to use as arguments.
For example, you may want to find the maximum value of
pending deposits across all accounts, which is calculated
by subtracting the available balance from the pending
balance. You can achieve this via the following query:
mysql> SELECT MAX(pending_balance - avail_balance)
max_uncleared
-> FROM account;
+---------------+
| max_uncleared |
+---------------+
| 660.00 |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
While this example uses a fairly simple expression,
expressions used as arguments to aggregate functions
can be as complex as needed, as long as they return a
number, string, or date. In Chapter 11, I show you how
you can use case expressions with aggregate functions to
determine whether a particular row should or should not
be included in an aggregation.
How Nulls Are Handled
When performing aggregations, or, indeed, any type of
numeric calculation, you should always consider how
null values might affect the outcome of your calculation.
To illustrate, I will build a simple table to hold numeric
data and populate it with the set {1, 3, 5}:
mysql> CREATE TABLE number_tbl
-> (val SMALLINT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO number_tbl VALUES (1);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> INSERT INTO number_tbl VALUES (3);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> INSERT INTO number_tbl VALUES (5);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
Consider the following query, which performs five
aggregate functions on the set of numbers:
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) num_rows,
-> COUNT(val) num_vals,
-> SUM(val) total,
-> MAX(val) max_val,
-> AVG(val) avg_val
-> FROM number_tbl;
+----------+----------+-------+---------+---------+
| num_rows | num_vals | total | max_val | avg_val |
+----------+----------+-------+---------+---------+
| 3 | 3 | 9 | 5 | 3.0000 |
+----------+----------+-------+---------+---------+
1 row in set (0.08 sec)
The results are as you would expect: both count(*) and
count(val) return the value 3, sum(val) returns the
value 9, max(val) returns 5, and avg(val) returns 3.
Next, I will add a null value to the number_tbl table and
run the query again:
mysql> INSERT INTO number_tbl VALUES (NULL);
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) num_rows,
-> COUNT(val) num_vals,
-> SUM(val) total,
-> MAX(val) max_val,
-> AVG(val) avg_val
-> FROM number_tbl;
+----------+----------+-------+---------+---------+
| num_rows | num_vals | total | max_val | avg_val |
+----------+----------+-------+---------+---------+
| 4 | 3 | 9 | 5 | 3.0000 |
+----------+----------+-------+---------+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Even with the addition of the null value to the table, the
sum(), max(), and avg() functions all return the same
values, indicating that they ignore any null values
encountered. The count(*) function now returns the
value 4, which is valid since the number_tbl table
contains four rows, while the count(val) function still
returns the value 3. The difference is that count(*)

counts the number of rows, whereas count(val) counts
the number of values contained in the val column and
ignores any null values encountered.

Generating Groups
People are rarely interested in looking at raw data;
instead, people engaging in data analysis will want to
manipulate the raw data to better suit their needs.
Examples of common data manipulations include:
Generating totals for a geographic region, such as
total European sales
Finding outliers, such as the top salesperson for 2005
Determining frequencies, such as the number of new
accounts opened for each branch
To answer these types of queries, you will need to ask the
database server to group rows together by one or more
columns or expressions. As you have seen already in
several examples, the group by clause is the mechanism
for grouping data within a query. In this section, you will
see how to group data by one or more columns, how to
group data using expressions, and how to generate
rollups within groups.
Single-Column Grouping
Single-column groups are the simplest and most-often-
used type of grouping. If you want to find the total
balances for each product, for example, you need only
group on the account.product_cd column, as in:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, SUM(avail_balance) prod_balance
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY product_cd;
+------------+--------------+
| product_cd | prod_balance |
+------------+--------------+
| BUS | 9345.55 |
| CD | 19500.00 |
| CHK | 73008.01 |
| MM | 17045.14 |
| SAV | 1855.76 |
| SBL | 50000.00 |
+------------+--------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query generates six groups, one for each product,
and then sums the available balances for each member of
the group.
Multicolumn Grouping

In some cases, you may want to generate groups that
span more than one column. Expanding on the previous
example, imagine that you want to find the total balances
not just for each product, but for both products and
branches (e.g., what’s the total balance for all checking
accounts opened at the Woburn branch?). The following
example shows how you can accomplish this:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id,
-> SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id;
+------------+----------------+-------------+
| product_cd | open_branch_id | tot_balance |
+------------+----------------+-------------+
| BUS | 2 | 9345.55 |
| BUS | 4 | 0.00 |
| CD | 1 | 11500.00 |
| CD | 2 | 8000.00 |
| CHK | 1 | 782.16 |
| CHK | 2 | 3315.77 |
| CHK | 3 | 1057.75 |
| CHK | 4 | 67852.33 |
| MM | 1 | 14832.64 |
| MM | 3 | 2212.50 |
| SAV | 1 | 767.77 |
| SAV | 2 | 700.00 |
| SAV | 4 | 387.99 |
| SBL | 3 | 50000.00 |
+------------+----------------+-------------+
14 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This version of the query generates 14 groups, one for
each combination of product and branch found in the
account table. Along with adding the open_branch_id
column to the select clause, I also added it to the group
by clause, since open_branch_id is retrieved from a table
and is not generated via an aggregate function.
Grouping via Expressions
Along with using columns to group data, you can build
groups based on the values generated by expressions.
Consider the following query, which groups employees by
the year they began working for the bank:
mysql> SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) year,
-> COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM employee
-> GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date);

+------+----------+
| year | how_many |
+------+----------+
| 2004 | 2 |
| 2005 | 3 |
| 2006 | 8 |
| 2007 | 3 |
| 2008 | 2 |
+------+----------+
5 rows in set (0.15 sec)
This query employs a fairly simple expression, which
uses the extract() function to return only the year
portion of a date, to group the rows in the employee
table.
Generating Rollups
In Multicolumn Grouping, I showed an example that
generates total account balances for each product and
branch. Let’s say, however, that along with the total
balances for each product/branch combination, you also
want total balances for each distinct product. You could
run an additional query and merge the results, you could
load the results of the query into a spreadsheet, or you
could build a Perl script, Java program, or some other
mechanism to take that data and perform the additional
calculations. Better yet, you could use the with rollup
option to have the database server do the work for you.
Here’s the revised query using with rollup in the group
by clause:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id,
-> SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id WITH ROLLUP;
+------------+----------------+-------------+
| product_cd | open_branch_id | tot_balance |
+------------+----------------+-------------+
| BUS | 2 | 9345.55 |
| BUS | 4 | 0.00 |
| BUS | NULL | 9345.55 |
| CD | 1 | 11500.00 |
| CD | 2 | 8000.00 |
| CD | NULL | 19500.00 |
| CHK | 1 | 782.16 |
| CHK | 2 | 3315.77 |
| CHK | 3 | 1057.75 |
| CHK | 4 | 67852.33 |

| CHK | NULL | 73008.01 |
| MM | 1 | 14832.64 |
| MM | 3 | 2212.50 |
| MM | NULL | 17045.14 |
| SAV | 1 | 767.77 |
| SAV | 2 | 700.00 |
| SAV | 4 | 387.99 |
| SAV | NULL | 1855.76 |
| SBL | 3 | 50000.00 |
| SBL | NULL | 50000.00 |
| NULL | NULL | 170754.46 |
+------------+----------------+-------------+
21 rows in set (0.02 sec)
There are now seven additional rows in the result set,
one for each of the six distinct products and one for the
grand total (all products combined). For the six product
rollups, a null value is provided for the open_branch_id
column, since the rollup is being performed across all
branches. Looking at the third line of the output, for
example, you will see that a total of $9,345.55 was
deposited in BUS accounts across all branches. For the
grand total row, a null value is provided for both the
product_cd and open_branch_id columns; the last line
of output shows a total of $170,754.46 across all
products and branches.
Note ✎
If you are using Oracle Database, you need to use a
slightly different syntax to indicate that you want a
rollup performed. The group by clause for the
previous query would look as follows when using
Oracle:
GROUP BY ROLLUP(product_cd, open_branch_id)
The advantage of this syntax is that it allows you to
perform rollups on a subset of the columns in the
group by clause. If you are grouping by columns a, b,
and c, for example, you could indicate that the server
should perform rollups on only b and c via the
following:
GROUP BY a, ROLLUP(b, c)

If, along with totals by product, you also want to
calculate totals per branch, then you can use the with
cube option, which generates summary rows for all
possible combinations of the grouping columns.
Unfortunately, with cube is not available in version 6.0
of MySQL, but it is available with SQL Server and Oracle
Database. Here’s an example using with cube, but I
have removed the mysql> prompt to show that the query
cannot yet be performed with MySQL:
SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id,
SUM(avail_balance) tot_balance
FROM account
GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id WITH CUBE;
+------------+----------------+-------------+
| product_cd | open_branch_id | tot_balance |
+------------+----------------+-------------+
| NULL | NULL | 170754.46 |
| NULL | 1 | 27882.57 |
| NULL | 2 | 21361.32 |
| NULL | 3 | 53270.25 |
| NULL | 4 | 68240.32 |
| BUS | 2 | 9345.55 |
| BUS | 4 | 0.00 |
| BUS | NULL | 9345.55 |
| CD | 1 | 11500.00 |
| CD | 2 | 8000.00 |
| CD | NULL | 19500.00 |
| CHK | 1 | 782.16 |
| CHK | 2 | 3315.77 |
| CHK | 3 | 1057.75 |
| CHK | 4 | 67852.33 |
| CHK | NULL | 73008.01 |
| MM | 1 | 14832.64 |
| MM | 3 | 2212.50 |
| MM | NULL | 17045.14 |
| SAV | 1 | 767.77 |
| SAV | 2 | 700.00 |
| SAV | 4 | 387.99 |
| SAV | NULL | 1855.76 |
| SBL | 3 | 50000.00 |
| SBL | NULL | 50000.00 |
+------------+----------------+-------------+
25 rows in set (0.02 sec)
Using with cube generates four more rows than the
with rollup version of the query, one for each of the
four branch IDs. Similar to with rollup, null values are

placed in the product_cd column to indicate that a
branch summary is being performed.
Note ✎
Once again, if you are using Oracle Database, you
need to use a slightly different syntax to indicate that
you want a cube operation performed. The group by
clause for the previous query would look as follows
when using Oracle:
GROUP BY CUBE(product_cd, open_branch_id)

Group Filter Conditions
In Chapter 4, I introduced you to various types of filter
conditions and showed how you can use them in the
where clause. When grouping data, you also can apply
filter conditions to the data after the groups have been
generated. The having clause is where you should place
these types of filter conditions. Consider the following
example:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, SUM(avail_balance) prod_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
-> GROUP BY product_cd
-> HAVING SUM(avail_balance) >= 10000;
+------------+--------------+
| product_cd | prod_balance |
+------------+--------------+
| CD | 19500.00 |
| CHK | 73008.01 |
| MM | 17045.14 |
| SBL | 50000.00 |
+------------+--------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query has two filter conditions: one in the where
clause, which filters out inactive accounts, and the other
in the having clause, which filters out any product whose
total available balance is less than $10,000. Thus, one of
the filters acts on data before it is grouped, and the other
filter acts on data after the groups have been created. If
you mistakenly put both filters in the where clause, you
will see the following error:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, SUM(avail_balance) prod_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
-> AND SUM(avail_balance) > 10000
-> GROUP BY product_cd;
ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function
This query fails because you cannot include an aggregate
function in a query’s where clause. This is because the
filters in the where clause are evaluated before the
grouping occurs, so the server can’t yet perform any
functions on groups.

Warning ☠
When adding filters to a query that includes a group
by clause, think carefully about whether the filter
acts on raw data, in which case it belongs in the
where clause, or on grouped data, in which case it
belongs in the having clause.
You may, however, include aggregate functions in the
having clause, that do not appear in the select clause,
as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, SUM(avail_balance) prod_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
-> GROUP BY product_cd
-> HAVING MIN(avail_balance) >= 1000
-> AND MAX(avail_balance) <= 10000;
+------------+--------------+
| product_cd | prod_balance |
+------------+--------------+
| CD | 19500.00 |
| MM | 17045.14 |
+------------+--------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query generates total balances for each active
product, but then the filter condition in the having clause
excludes all products for which the minimum balance is
less than $1,000 or the maximum balance is greater than
$10,000.

Test Your Knowledge
Work through the following exercises to test your grasp
of SQL’s grouping and aggregating features. Check your
work with the answers in Appendix C.
Exercise 8-1
Construct a query that counts the number of rows in the
account table.
Exercise 8-2
Modify your query from Exercise 8-1 to count the
number of accounts held by each customer. Show the
customer ID and the number of accounts for each
customer.
Exercise 8-3
Modify your query from Exercise 8-2 to include only
those customers having at least two accounts.
Exercise 8-4 (Extra Credit)
Find the total available balance by product and branch
where there is more than one account per product and
branch. Order the results by total balance (highest to
lowest).

Chapter 9. Subqueries
Subqueries are a powerful tool that you can use in all
four SQL data statements. This chapter explores in great
detail the many uses of the subquery.
What Is a Subquery?
A subquery is a query contained within another SQL
statement (which I refer to as the containing statement
for the rest of this discussion). A subquery is always
enclosed within parentheses, and it is usually executed
prior to the containing statement. Like any query, a
subquery returns a result set that may consist of:
A single row with a single column
Multiple rows with a single column
Multiple rows and columns
The type of result set the subquery returns determines
how it may be used and which operators the containing
statement may use to interact with the data the subquery
returns. When the containing statement has finished
executing, the data returned by any subqueries is
discarded, making a subquery act like a temporary table
with statement scope (meaning that the server frees up
any memory allocated to the subquery results after the
SQL statement has finished execution).
You already saw several examples of subqueries in
earlier chapters, but here’s a simple example to get
started:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE account_id = (SELECT MAX(account_id) FROM
account);
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 29 | SBL | 13 | 50000.00 |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.65 sec)
In this example, the subquery returns the maximum
value found in the account_id column in the account
table, and the containing statement then returns data
about that account. If you are ever confused about what

a subquery is doing, you can run the subquery by itself
(without the parentheses) to see what it returns. Here’s
the subquery from the previous example:
mysql> SELECT MAX(account_id) FROM account;
+-----------------+
| MAX(account_id) |
+-----------------+
| 29 |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
So, the subquery returns a single row with a single
column, which allows it to be used as one of the
expressions in an equality condition (if the subquery
returned two or more rows, it could be compared to
something but could not be equal to anything, but more
on this later). In this case, you can take the value the
subquery returned and substitute it into the righthand
expression of the filter condition in the containing query,
as in:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE account_id = 29;
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 29 | SBL | 13 | 50000.00 |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)
The subquery is useful in this case because it allows you
to retrieve information about the highest numbered
account in a single query, rather than retrieving the
maximum account_id using one query and then writing
a second query to retrieve the desired data from the
account table. As you will see, subqueries are useful in
many other situations as well, and may become one of
the most powerful tools in your SQL toolkit.

Subquery Types
Along with the differences noted previously regarding
the type of result set a subquery returns (single
row/column, single row/multicolumn, or multiple
columns), you can use another factor to differentiate
subqueries; some subqueries are completely self-
contained (called noncorrelated subqueries), while
others reference columns from the containing statement
(called correlated subqueries). The next several sections
explore these two subquery types and show the different
operators that you can employ to interact with them.

Noncorrelated Subqueries
The example from earlier in the chapter is a
noncorrelated subquery; it may be executed alone and
does not reference anything from the containing
statement. Most subqueries that you encounter will be of
this type unless you are writing update or delete
statements, which frequently make use of correlated
subqueries (more on this later). Along with being
noncorrelated, the example from earlier in the chapter
also returns a table comprising a single row and column.
This type of subquery is known as a scalar subquery and
can appear on either side of a condition using the usual
operators (=, <>, <, >, <=, >=). The next example shows
how you can use a scalar subquery in an inequality
condition:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE open_emp_id <> (SELECT e.emp_id
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> WHERE e.title = 'Head Teller' AND b.city = 'Woburn');
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id | avail_balance |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
| 7 | CHK | 3 | 1057.75 |
| 8 | MM | 3 | 2212.50 |
| 10 | CHK | 4 | 534.12 |
| 11 | SAV | 4 | 767.77 |
| 12 | MM | 4 | 5487.09 |
| 13 | CHK | 5 | 2237.97 |
| 14 | CHK | 6 | 122.37 |

| 25 | BUS | 10 | 0.00 |

| 29 | SBL | 13 | 50000.00 |
+------------+------------+---------+---------------+
17 rows in set (0.86 sec)
This query returns data concerning all accounts that
were not opened by the head teller at the Woburn branch

(the subquery is written using the assumption that there
is only a single head teller at each branch). The subquery
in this example is a bit more complex than in the
previous example, in that it joins two tables and includes
two filter conditions. Subqueries may be as simple or as
complex as you need them to be, and they may utilize any
and all the available query clauses (select, from, where,
group by, having, and order by).
If you use a subquery in an equality condition, but the
subquery returns more than one row, you will receive an
error. For example, if you modify the previous query such
that the subquery returns all tellers at the Woburn
branch instead of the single head teller, you will receive
the following error:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE open_emp_id <> (SELECT e.emp_id
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> WHERE e.title = 'Teller' AND b.city = 'Woburn');
ERROR 1242 (21000): Subquery returns more than 1 row
If you run the subquery by itself, you will see the
following results:
mysql> SELECT e.emp_id
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON e.assigned_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> WHERE e.title = 'Teller' AND b.city = 'Woburn';
+--------+
| emp_id |
+--------+
| 11 |
| 12 |
+--------+
2 rows in set (0.02 sec)
The containing query fails because an expression
(open_emp_id) cannot be equated to a set of expressions
(emp_ids 11 and 12). In other words, a single thing
cannot be equated to a set of things. In the next section,
you will see how to fix the problem by using a different
operator.
Multiple-Row, Single-Column Subqueries

If your subquery returns more than one row, you will not
be able to use it on one side of an equality condition, as
the previous example demonstrated. However, there are
four additional operators that you can use to build
conditions with these types of subqueries.
The in and not in operators
While you can’t equate a single value to a set of values,
you can check to see whether a single value can be found
within a set of values. The next example, while it doesn’t
use a subquery, demonstrates how to build a condition
that uses the in operator to search for a value within a
set of values:
mysql> SELECT branch_id, name, city
-> FROM branch
-> WHERE name IN ('Headquarters', 'Quincy Branch');
+-----------+---------------+---------+
| branch_id | name | city |
+-----------+---------------+---------+
| 1 | Headquarters | Waltham |
| 3 | Quincy Branch | Quincy |
+-----------+---------------+---------+
2 rows in set (0.03 sec)
The expression on the lefthand side of the condition is
the name column, while the righthand side of the
condition is a set of strings. The in operator checks to
see whether either of the strings can be found in the
name column; if so, the condition is met and the row is
added to the result set. You could achieve the same
results using two equality conditions, as in:
mysql> SELECT branch_id, name, city
-> FROM branch
-> WHERE name = 'Headquarters' OR name = 'Quincy Branch';
+-----------+---------------+---------+
| branch_id | name | city |
+-----------+---------------+---------+
| 1 | Headquarters | Waltham |
| 3 | Quincy Branch | Quincy |
+-----------+---------------+---------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
While this approach seems reasonable when the set
contains only two expressions, it is easy to see why a
single condition using the in operator would be

preferable if the set contained dozens (or hundreds,
thousands, etc.) of values.
Although you will occasionally create a set of strings,
dates, or numbers to use on one side of a condition, you
are more likely to generate the set at query execution via
a subquery that returns one or more rows. The following
query uses the in operator with a subquery on the
righthand side of the filter condition to see which
employees supervise other employees:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE emp_id IN (SELECT superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee);
+--------+---------+-----------+--------------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | title |
+--------+---------+-----------+--------------------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith | President |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler | Treasurer |
| 4 | Susan | Hawthorne | Operations Manager |
| 6 | Helen | Fleming | Head Teller |
| 10 | Paula | Roberts | Head Teller |
| 13 | John | Blake | Head Teller |
| 16 | Theresa | Markham | Head Teller |
+--------+---------+-----------+--------------------+
7 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The subquery returns the IDs of all employees who
supervise other employees, and the containing query
retrieves four columns from the employee table for these
employees. Here are the results of the subquery:
mysql> SELECT superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee;
+-----------------+
| superior_emp_id |
+-----------------+
| NULL |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 4 |
| 6 |
| 6 |
| 6 |
| 10 |

| 10 |
| 13 |
| 13 |
| 16 |
| 16 |
+-----------------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
As you can see, some employee IDs are listed more than
once, since some employees supervise multiple people.
This doesn’t adversely affect the results of the containing
query, since it doesn’t matter whether an employee ID
can be found in the result set of the subquery once or
more than once. Of course, you could add the distinct
keyword to the subquery’s select clause if it bothers you
to have duplicates in the table returned by the subquery,
but it won’t change the containing query’s result set.
Along with seeing whether a value exists within a set of
values, you can check the converse using the not in
operator. Here’s another version of the previous query
using not in instead of in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE emp_id NOT IN (SELECT superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id IS NOT NULL);
+--------+----------+----------+----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | title |
+--------+----------+----------+----------------+
| 2 | Susan | Barker | Vice President |
| 5 | John | Gooding | Loan Manager |
| 7 | Chris | Tucker | Teller |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | Teller |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | Teller |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler | Teller |
| 12 | Samantha | Jameson | Teller |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | Teller |
| 15 | Frank | Portman | Teller |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | Teller |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | Teller |
+--------+----------+----------+----------------+
11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query finds all employees who do not supervise
other people. For this query, I needed to add a filter
condition to the subquery to ensure that null values do
not appear in the table returned by the subquery; see the

next section for an explanation of why this filter is
needed in this case.
The all operator
While the in operator is used to see whether an
expression can be found within a set of expressions, the
all operator allows you to make comparisons between a
single value and every value in a set. To build such a
condition, you will need to use one of the comparison
operators (=, <>, <, >, etc.) in conjunction with the all
operator. For example, the next query finds all employees
whose employee IDs are not equal to any of the
supervisor employee IDs:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE emp_id <> ALL (SELECT superior_emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE superior_emp_id IS NOT NULL);
+--------+----------+----------+----------------+
| emp_id | fname | lname | title |
+--------+----------+----------+----------------+
| 2 | Susan | Barker | Vice President |
| 5 | John | Gooding | Loan Manager |
| 7 | Chris | Tucker | Teller |
| 8 | Sarah | Parker | Teller |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman | Teller |
| 11 | Thomas | Ziegler | Teller |
| 12 | Samantha | Jameson | Teller |
| 14 | Cindy | Mason | Teller |
| 15 | Frank | Portman | Teller |
| 17 | Beth | Fowler | Teller |
| 18 | Rick | Tulman | Teller |
+--------+----------+----------+----------------+
11 rows in set (0.05 sec)
Once again, the subquery returns the set of IDs for those
employees who supervise other people, and the
containing query returns data for each employee whose
ID is not equal to all of the IDs returned by the subquery.
In other words, the query finds all employees who are not
supervisors. If this approach seems a bit clumsy to you,
you are in good company; most people would prefer to
phrase the query differently and avoid using the all
operator. For example, this query generates the same
results as the last example in the previous section, which

used the not in operator. It’s a matter of preference, but
I think that most people would find the version that uses
not in to be easier to understand.
Note ✎
When using not in or <> all to compare a value to
a set of values, you must be careful to ensure that the
set of values does not contain a null value, because
the server equates the value on the lefthand side of
the expression to each member of the set, and any
attempt to equate a value to null yields unknown.
Thus, the following query returns an empty set:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, title
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE emp_id NOT IN (1, 2, NULL);
Empty set (0.00 sec)
In some cases, the all operator is a bit more natural.
The next example uses all to find accounts having an
available balance smaller than all of Frank Tucker’s
accounts:
mysql> SELECT account_id, cust_id, product_cd, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE avail_balance < ALL (SELECT a.avail_balance
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN individual i
-> ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id
-> WHERE i.fname = 'Frank' AND i.lname = 'Tucker');
+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
| account_id | cust_id | product_cd | avail_balance |
+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
| 2 | 1 | SAV | 500.00 |
| 5 | 2 | SAV | 200.00 |
| 10 | 4 | CHK | 534.12 |
| 11 | 4 | SAV | 767.77 |
| 14 | 6 | CHK | 122.37 |
| 19 | 8 | SAV | 387.99 |
| 21 | 9 | CHK | 125.67 |
| 25 | 10 | BUS | 0.00 |
+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
8 rows in set (0.17 sec)
Here’s the data returned by the subquery, which consists
of the available balance from each of Frank’s accounts:
mysql> SELECT a.avail_balance
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN individual i
-> ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id
-> WHERE i.fname = 'Frank' AND i.lname = 'Tucker';

+---------------+
| avail_balance |
+---------------+
| 1057.75 |
| 2212.50 |
+---------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
Frank has two accounts, with the lowest balance being
$1,057.75. The containing query finds all accounts
having a balance smaller than any of Frank’s accounts,
so the result set includes all accounts having a balance
less than $1,057.75.
The any operator
Like the all operator, the any operator allows a value to
be compared to the members of a set of values; unlike
all, however, a condition using the any operator
evaluates to true as soon as a single comparison is
favorable. This is different from the previous example
using the all operator, which evaluates to true only if
comparisons against all members of the set are
favorable. For example, you might want to find all
accounts having an available balance greater than any of
Frank Tucker’s accounts:
mysql> SELECT account_id, cust_id, product_cd, avail_balance
-> FROM account
-> WHERE avail_balance > ANY (SELECT a.avail_balance
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN individual i
-> ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id
-> WHERE i.fname = 'Frank' AND i.lname = 'Tucker');
+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
| account_id | cust_id | product_cd | avail_balance |
+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
| 3 | 1 | CD | 3000.00 |
| 4 | 2 | CHK | 2258.02 |
| 8 | 3 | MM | 2212.50 |
| 12 | 4 | MM | 5487.09 |
| 13 | 5 | CHK | 2237.97 |
| 15 | 6 | CD | 10000.00 |
| 17 | 7 | CD | 5000.00 |
| 18 | 8 | CHK | 3487.19 |
| 22 | 9 | MM | 9345.55 |
| 23 | 9 | CD | 1500.00 |
| 24 | 10 | CHK | 23575.12 |
| 27 | 11 | BUS | 9345.55 |
| 28 | 12 | CHK | 38552.05 |
| 29 | 13 | SBL | 50000.00 |

+------------+---------+------------+---------------+
14 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Frank has two accounts with balances of $1,057.75 and
$2,212.50; to have a balance greater than any of these
two accounts, an account must have a balance of at least
$1,057.75.
Note ✎
Although most people prefer to use in, using = any is
equivalent to using the in operator.
Multicolumn Subqueries
So far, all of the subquery examples in this chapter have
returned a single column and one or more rows. In
certain situations, however, you can use subqueries that
return two or more columns. To show the utility of
multiple-column subqueries, it might help to look first at
an example that uses multiple, single-column subqueries:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE open_branch_id = (SELECT branch_id
-> FROM branch
-> WHERE name = 'Woburn Branch')
-> AND open_emp_id IN (SELECT emp_id
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE title = 'Teller' OR title = 'Head Teller');
+------------+------------+---------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1 | CHK | 1 |
| 2 | SAV | 1 |
| 3 | CD | 1 |
| 4 | CHK | 2 |
| 5 | SAV | 2 |
| 17 | CD | 7 |
| 27 | BUS | 11 |
+------------+------------+---------+
7 rows in set (0.09 sec)
This query uses two subqueries to identify the ID of the
Woburn branch and the IDs of all bank tellers, and the
containing query then uses this information to retrieve
all checking accounts opened by a teller at the Woburn
branch. However, since the employee table includes
information about which branch each employee is
assigned to, you can achieve the same results by

comparing both the account.open_branch_id and
account.open_emp_id columns to a single subquery
against the employee and branch tables. To do so, your
filter condition must name both columns from the
account table surrounded by parentheses and in the
same order as returned by the subquery, as in:
mysql> SELECT account_id, product_cd, cust_id
-> FROM account
-> WHERE (open_branch_id, open_emp_id) IN
-> (SELECT b.branch_id, e.emp_id
-> FROM branch b INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON b.branch_id = e.assigned_branch_id
-> WHERE b.name = 'Woburn Branch'
-> AND (e.title = 'Teller' OR e.title = 'Head
Teller'));
+------------+------------+---------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1 | CHK | 1 |
| 2 | SAV | 1 |
| 3 | CD | 1 |
| 4 | CHK | 2 |
| 5 | SAV | 2 |
| 17 | CD | 7 |
| 27 | BUS | 11 |
+------------+------------+---------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This version of the query performs the same function as
the previous example, but with a single subquery that
returns two columns instead of two subqueries that each
return a single column.
Of course, you could rewrite the previous example simply
to join the three tables instead of using a subquery, but
it’s helpful when learning SQL to see multiple ways of
achieving the same results. Here’s another example,
however, that requires a subquery. Let’s say that there
have been some customer complaints regarding incorrect
values in the available/pending balance columns in the
account table. Your job is to find all accounts whose
balances don’t match the sum of the transaction amounts
for that account. Here’s a partial solution to the problem:
SELECT 'ALERT! : Account #1 Has Incorrect Balance!'
FROM account
WHERE (avail_balance, pending_balance) <>
(SELECT SUM(<expression to generate available balance>),

SUM(<expression to generate pending balance>)
FROM transaction
WHERE account_id = 1)
AND account_id = 1;
As you can see, I have neglected to fill in the expressions
used to sum the transaction amounts for the available
and pending balance calculations, but I promise to finish
the job in Chapter 11 after you learn how to build case
expressions. Even so, the query is complete enough to
see that the subquery is generating two sums from the
transaction table that are then compared to the
avail_balance and pending_balance columns in the
account table. Both the subquery and the containing
query include the filter condition account_id = 1, so the
query in its present form will check only a single account
at a time. In the next section, you will learn how to write
a more general form of the query that will check all
accounts with a single execution.

Correlated Subqueries
All of the subqueries shown thus far have been
independent of their containing statements, meaning
that you can execute them by themselves and inspect the
results. A correlated subquery, on the other hand, is
dependent on its containing statement from which it
references one or more columns. Unlike a noncorrelated
subquery, a correlated subquery is not executed once
prior to execution of the containing statement; instead,
the correlated subquery is executed once for each
candidate row (rows that might be included in the final
results). For example, the following query uses a
correlated subquery to count the number of accounts for
each customer, and the containing query then retrieves
those customers having exactly two accounts:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.cust_type_cd, c.city
-> FROM customer c
-> WHERE 2 = (SELECT COUNT(*)
-> FROM account a
-> WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id);
+---------+--------------+---------+
| cust_id | cust_type_cd | city |
+---------+--------------+---------+
| 2 | I | Woburn |
| 3 | I | Quincy |
| 6 | I | Waltham |
| 8 | I | Salem |
| 10 | B | Salem |
+---------+--------------+---------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The reference to c.cust_id at the very end of the
subquery is what makes the subquery correlated; the
containing query must supply values for c.cust_id for
the subquery to execute. In this case, the containing
query retrieves all 13 rows from the customer table and
executes the subquery once for each customer, passing in
the appropriate customer ID for each execution. If the
subquery returns the value 2, then the filter condition is
met and the row is added to the result set.
Along with equality conditions, you can use correlated
subqueries in other types of conditions, such as the
range condition illustrated here:

mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.cust_type_cd, c.city
-> FROM customer c
-> WHERE (SELECT SUM(a.avail_balance)
-> FROM account a
-> WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id)
-> BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000;
+---------+--------------+------------+
| cust_id | cust_type_cd | city |
+---------+--------------+------------+
| 4 | I | Waltham |
| 7 | I | Wilmington |
| 11 | B | Wilmington |
+---------+--------------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.02 sec)
This variation on the previous query finds all customers
whose total available balance across all accounts lies
between $5,000 and $10,000. Once again, the correlated
subquery is executed 13 times (once for each customer
row), and each execution of the subquery returns the
total account balance for the given customer.
Note ✎
Another subtle difference in the previous query is
that the subquery is on the lefthand side of the
condition, which may look a bit odd but is perfectly
valid.
At the end of the previous section, I demonstrated how to
check the available and pending balances of an account
against the transactions logged against the account, and
I promised to show you how to modify the example to run
all accounts in a single execution. Here’s the example
again:
SELECT 'ALERT! : Account #1 Has Incorrect Balance!'
FROM account
WHERE (avail_balance, pending_balance) <>
(SELECT SUM(<expression to generate available balance>),
SUM(<expression to generate pending balance>)
FROM transaction
WHERE account_id = 1)
AND account_id = 1;
Using a correlated subquery instead of a noncorrelated
subquery, you can execute the containing query once,
and the subquery will be run for each account. Here’s
the updated version:

SELECT CONCAT('ALERT! : Account #', a.account_id,
' Has Incorrect Balance!')
FROM account a
WHERE (a.avail_balance, a.pending_balance) <>
(SELECT SUM(<expression to generate available balance>),
SUM(<expression to generate pending balance>)
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id);
The subquery now includes a filter condition linking the
transaction’s account ID to the account ID from the
containing query. The select clause has also been
modified to concatenate an alert message that includes
the account ID rather than the hardcoded value 1.
The exists Operator
While you will often see correlated subqueries used in
equality and range conditions, the most common
operator used to build conditions that utilize correlated
subqueries is the exists operator. You use the exists
operator when you want to identify that a relationship
exists without regard for the quantity; for example, the
following query finds all the accounts for which a
transaction was posted on a particular day, without
regard for how many transactions were posted:
SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, a.cust_id, a.avail_balance
FROM account a
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id
AND t.txn_date = '2008-09-22');
Using the exists operator, your subquery can return
zero, one, or many rows, and the condition simply checks
whether the subquery returned any rows. If you look at
the select clause of the subquery, you will see that it
consists of a single literal (1); since the condition in the
containing query only needs to know how many rows
have been returned, the actual data the subquery
returned is irrelevant. Your subquery can return
whatever strikes your fancy, as demonstrated next:
SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, a.cust_id, a.avail_balance
FROM account a
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT t.txn_id, 'hello', 3.1415927
FROM transaction t

WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id
AND t.txn_date = '2008-09-22');
However, the convention is to specify either select 1 or
select * when using exists.
You may also use not exists to check for subqueries
that return no rows, as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, a.cust_id
-> FROM account a
-> WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
-> FROM business b
-> WHERE b.cust_id = a.cust_id);
+------------+------------+---------+
| account_id | product_cd | cust_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1 | CHK | 1 |
| 2 | SAV | 1 |
| 3 | CD | 1 |
| 4 | CHK | 2 |
| 5 | SAV | 2 |
| 7 | CHK | 3 |
| 8 | MM | 3 |
| 10 | CHK | 4 |
| 11 | SAV | 4 |
| 12 | MM | 4 |
| 13 | CHK | 5 |
| 14 | CHK | 6 |
| 15 | CD | 6 |
| 17 | CD | 7 |
| 18 | CHK | 8 |
| 19 | SAV | 8 |
| 21 | CHK | 9 |
| 22 | MM | 9 |
| 23 | CD | 9 |
+------------+------------+---------+
19 rows in set (0.99 sec)
This query finds all customers whose customer ID does
not appear in the business table, which is a roundabout
way of finding all nonbusiness customers.
Data Manipulation Using Correlated
Subqueries
All of the examples thus far in the chapter have been
select statements, but don’t think that means that
subqueries aren’t useful in other SQL statements.
Subqueries are used heavily in update, delete, and
insert statements as well, with correlated subqueries

appearing frequently in update and delete statements.
Here’s an example of a correlated subquery used to
modify the last_activity_date column in the account
table:
UPDATE account a
SET a.last_activity_date =
(SELECT MAX(t.txn_date)
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id);
This statement modifies every row in the account table
(since there is no where clause) by finding the latest
transaction date for each account. While it seems
reasonable to expect that every account will have at least
one transaction linked to it, it would be best to check
whether an account has any transactions before
attempting to update the last_activity_date column;
otherwise, the column will be set to null, since the
subquery would return no rows. Here’s another version
of the update statement, this time employing a where
clause with a second correlated subquery:
UPDATE account a
SET a.last_activity_date =
(SELECT MAX(t.txn_date)
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id)
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id);
The two correlated subqueries are identical except for
the select clauses. The subquery in the set clause,
however, executes only if the condition in the update
statement’s where clause evaluates to true (meaning
that at least one transaction was found for the account),
thus protecting the data in the last_activity_date
column from being overwritten with a null.
Correlated subqueries are also common in delete
statements. For example, you may run a data
maintenance script at the end of each month that
removes unnecessary data. The script might include the
following statement, which removes data from the
department table that has no child rows in the employee
table:

DELETE FROM department
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
FROM employee
WHERE employee.dept_id = department.dept_id);
When using correlated subqueries with delete
statements in MySQL, keep in mind that, for whatever
reason, table aliases are not allowed when using delete,
which is why I had to use the entire table name in the
subquery. With most other database servers, you could
provide aliases for the department and employee tables,
such as:
DELETE FROM department d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1
FROM employee e
WHERE e.dept_id = d.dept_id);

When to Use Subqueries
Now that you have learned about the different types of
subqueries and the different operators that you can
employ to interact with the data returned by subqueries,
it’s time to explore the many ways in which you can use
subqueries to build powerful SQL statements. The next
three sections demonstrate how you may use subqueries
to construct custom tables, to build conditions, and to
generate column values in result sets.
Subqueries As Data Sources
Back in Chapter 3, I stated that the from clause of a
select statement names the tables to be used by the
query. Since a subquery generates a result set containing
rows and columns of data, it is perfectly valid to include
subqueries in your from clause along with tables.
Although it might, at first glance, seem like an
interesting feature without much practical merit, using
subqueries alongside tables is one of the most powerful
tools available when writing queries. Here’s a simple
example:
mysql> SELECT d.dept_id, d.name, e_cnt.how_many num_employees
-> FROM department d INNER JOIN
-> (SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM employee
-> GROUP BY dept_id) e_cnt
-> ON d.dept_id = e_cnt.dept_id;
+---------+----------------+---------------+
| dept_id | name | num_employees |
+---------+----------------+---------------+
| 1 | Operations | 14 |
| 2 | Loans | 1 |
| 3 | Administration | 3 |
+---------+----------------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.04 sec)
In this example, a subquery generates a list of
department IDs along with the number of employees
assigned to each department. Here’s the result set
generated by the subquery:
mysql> SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM employee
-> GROUP BY dept_id;
+---------+----------+

| dept_id | how_many |
+---------+----------+
| 1 | 14 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 3 |
+---------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The subquery is given the name e_cnt and is joined to
the department table via the dept_id column. The
containing query then retrieves the department ID and
name from the department table, along with the
employee count from the e_cnt subquery.
Subqueries used in the from clause must be
noncorrelated; they are executed first, and the data is
held in memory until the containing query finishes
execution. Subqueries offer immense flexibility when
writing queries, because you can go far beyond the set of
available tables to create virtually any view of the data
that you desire, and then join the results to other tables
or subqueries. If you are writing reports or generating
data feeds to external systems, you may be able to do
things with a single query that used to demand multiple
queries or a procedural language to accomplish.
Data fabrication
Along with using subqueries to summarize existing data,
you can use subqueries to generate data that doesn’t
exist in any form within your database. For example, you
may wish to group your customers by the amount of
money held in deposit accounts, but you want to use
group definitions that are not stored in your database.
For example, let’s say you want to sort your customers
into the groups shown in Table 9-1.
Table 9-1. Customer balance groups
Group name Lower limit Upper limit
Small Fry 0 $4,999.99
Average Joes $5,000 $9,999.99
Heavy Hitters $10,000 $9,999,999.99
To generate these groups within a single query, you will
need a way to define these three groups. The first step is
to define a query that generates the group definitions:

mysql> SELECT 'Small Fry' name, 0 low_limit, 4999.99
high_limit
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'Average Joes' name, 5000 low_limit, 9999.99
high_limit
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'Heavy Hitters' name, 10000 low_limit,
9999999.99 high_limit;
+---------------+-----------+------------+
| name | low_limit | high_limit |
+---------------+-----------+------------+
| Small Fry | 0 | 4999.99 |
| Average Joes | 5000 | 9999.99 |
| Heavy Hitters | 10000 | 9999999.99 |
+---------------+-----------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
I have used the set operator union all to merge the
results from three separate queries into a single result
set. Each query retrieves three literals, and the results
from the three queries are put together to generate a
result set with three rows and three columns. You now
have a query to generate the desired groups, and you can
place it into the from clause of another query to generate
your customer groups:
mysql> SELECT groups.name, COUNT(*) num_customers
-> FROM
-> (SELECT SUM(a.avail_balance) cust_balance
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN product p
-> ON a.product_cd = p.product_cd
-> WHERE p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT'
-> GROUP BY a.cust_id) cust_rollup
-> INNER JOIN
-> (SELECT 'Small Fry' name, 0 low_limit, 4999.99
high_limit
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'Average Joes' name, 5000 low_limit,
-> 9999.99 high_limit
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'Heavy Hitters' name, 10000 low_limit,
-> 9999999.99 high_limit) groups
-> ON cust_rollup.cust_balance
-> BETWEEN groups.low_limit AND groups.high_limit
-> GROUP BY groups.name;
+---------------+---------------+
| name | num_customers |
+---------------+---------------+
| Average Joes | 2 |
| Heavy Hitters | 4 |
| Small Fry | 5 |

+---------------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The from clause contains two subqueries; the first
subquery, named cust_rollup, returns the total deposit
balances for each customer, while the second subquery,
named groups, generates the three customer groupings.
Here’s the data generated by cust_rollup:
mysql> SELECT SUM(a.avail_balance) cust_balance
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN product p
-> ON a.product_cd = p.product_cd
-> WHERE p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT'
-> GROUP BY a.cust_id;
+--------------+
| cust_balance |
+--------------+
| 4557.75 |
| 2458.02 |
| 3270.25 |
| 6788.98 |
| 2237.97 |
| 10122.37 |
| 5000.00 |
| 3875.18 |
| 10971.22 |
| 23575.12 |
| 38552.05 |
+--------------+
11 rows in set (0.05 sec)
The data generated by cust_rollup is then joined to the
groups table via a range condition
(cust_rollup.cust_balance BETWEEN groups.low_limit
AND groups.high_limit). Finally, the joined data is
grouped and the number of customers in each group is
counted to generate the final result set.
Of course, you could simply decide to build a permanent
table to hold the group definitions instead of using a
subquery. Using that approach, you would find your
database to be littered with small special-purpose tables
after awhile, and you wouldn’t remember the reason for
which most of them were created. I’ve worked in
environments where the database users were allowed to
create their own tables for special purposes, and the
results were disastrous (tables not included in backups,
tables lost during server upgrades, server downtime due

to space allocation issues, etc.). Armed with subqueries,
however, you will be able to adhere to a policy where
tables are added to a database only when there is a clear
business need to store new data.
Task-oriented subqueries
In systems used for reporting or data-feed generation,
you will often come across queries such as the following:
mysql> SELECT p.name product, b.name branch,
-> CONCAT(e.fname, ' ', e.lname) name,
-> SUM(a.avail_balance) tot_deposits
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN employee e
-> ON a.open_emp_id = e.emp_id
-> INNER JOIN branch b
-> ON a.open_branch_id = b.branch_id
-> INNER JOIN product p
-> ON a.product_cd = p.product_cd
-> WHERE p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT'
-> GROUP BY p.name, b.name, e.fname, e.lname
-> ORDER BY 1,2;

11 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query sums all deposit account balances by account
type, the employee that opened the accounts, and the
branches at which the accounts were opened. If you look
at the query closely, you will see that the product,
branch, and employee tables are needed only for display
purposes, and that the account table has everything
needed to generate the groupings (product_cd,
open_branch_id, open_emp_id, and avail_balance).
Therefore, you could separate out the task of generating
the groups into a subquery, and then join the other three
tables to the table generated by the subquery to achieve
the desired end result. Here’s the grouping subquery:
mysql> SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id branch_id,
open_emp_id emp_id,
-> SUM(avail_balance) tot_deposits
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id, open_emp_id;

| SBL | 3 | 13 | 50000.00 |
+------------+-----------+--------+--------------+
14 rows in set (0.02 sec)
This is the heart of the query; the other tables are
needed only to provide meaningful strings in place of the
product_cd, open_branch_id, and open_emp_id foreign
key columns. The next query wraps the query against the
account table in a subquery and joins the table that
results to the other three tables:

mysql> SELECT p.name product, b.name branch,
-> CONCAT(e.fname, ' ', e.lname) name,
-> account_groups.tot_deposits
-> FROM
-> (SELECT product_cd, open_branch_id branch_id,
-> open_emp_id emp_id,
-> SUM(avail_balance) tot_deposits
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY product_cd, open_branch_id, open_emp_id)
account_groups
-> INNER JOIN employee e ON e.emp_id =
account_groups.emp_id
-> INNER JOIN branch b ON b.branch_id =
account_groups.branch_id
-> INNER JOIN product p ON p.product_cd =
account_groups.product_cd
-> WHERE p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT';

11 rows in set (0.01 sec)
I realize that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I
find this version of the query to be far more satisfying

than the big, flat version. This version may execute
faster, as well, because the grouping is being done on
small, numeric foreign key columns (product_cd,
open_branch_id, open_emp_id) instead of potentially
lengthy string columns (branch.name, product.name,
employee.fname, employee.lname).
Subqueries in Filter Conditions
Many of the examples in this chapter used subqueries as
expressions in filter conditions, so it should not surprise
you that this is one of the main uses for subqueries.
However, filter conditions using subqueries are not found
only in the where clause. For example, the next query
uses a subquery in the having clause to find the
employee responsible for opening the most accounts:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MAX(emp_cnt.how_many)
-> FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id) emp_cnt);
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 1 | 8 |
+-------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
The subquery in the having clause finds the maximum
number of accounts opened by any employee, and the
containing query finds the employee that has opened that
number of accounts. If multiple employees tie for the
highest number of opened accounts, then the query
would return multiple rows.
Subqueries As Expression Generators
For this last section of the chapter, I finish where I
began: with single-column, single-row scalar subqueries.
Along with being used in filter conditions, scalar
subqueries may be used wherever an expression can
appear, including the select and order by clauses of a
query and the values clause of an insert statement.

In Task-oriented subqueries, I showed you how to use a
subquery to separate out the grouping mechanism from
the rest of the query. Here’s another version of the same
query that uses subqueries for the same purpose, but in
a different way:
mysql> SELECT
-> (SELECT p.name FROM product p
-> WHERE p.product_cd = a.product_cd
-> AND p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT') product,
-> (SELECT b.name FROM branch b
-> WHERE b.branch_id = a.open_branch_id) branch,
-> (SELECT CONCAT(e.fname, ' ', e.lname) FROM employee e
-> WHERE e.emp_id = a.open_emp_id) name,
-> SUM(a.avail_balance) tot_deposits
-> FROM account a
-> GROUP BY a.product_cd, a.open_branch_id, a.open_emp_id
-> ORDER BY 1,2;

14 rows in set (0.01 sec)
There are two main differences between this query and
the earlier version using a subquery in the from clause:
Instead of joining the product, branch, and employee
tables to the account data, correlated scalar
subqueries are used in the select clause to look up
the product, branch, and employee names.
The result set has 14 rows instead of 11 rows, and
three of the product names are null.
The reason for the extra three rows in the result set is
that the previous version of the query included the filter
condition p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT'. That filter
eliminated rows with product types of INSURANCE and
LOAN, such as small business loans. Since this version of
the query doesn’t include a join to the product table,
there is no way to include the filter condition in the main
query. The correlated subquery against the product table
does include this filter, but the only effect is to leave the
product name null. If you want to get rid of the extra
three rows, you could join the product table to the
account table and include the filter condition, or you
could simply do the following:
mysql> SELECT all_prods.product, all_prods.branch,
-> all_prods.name, all_prods.tot_deposits
-> FROM
-> (SELECT
-> (SELECT p.name FROM product p
-> WHERE p.product_cd = a.product_cd
-> AND p.product_type_cd = 'ACCOUNT') product,
-> (SELECT b.name FROM branch b
-> WHERE b.branch_id = a.open_branch_id) branch,
-> (SELECT CONCAT(e.fname, ' ', e.lname) FROM employee
e
-> WHERE e.emp_id = a.open_emp_id) name,
-> SUM(a.avail_balance) tot_deposits
-> FROM account a
-> GROUP BY a.product_cd, a.open_branch_id,
a.open_emp_id
-> ) all_prods
-> WHERE all_prods.product IS NOT NULL
-> ORDER BY 1,2;

11 rows in set (0.01 sec)
Simply by wrapping the previous query in a subquery
(called all_prods) and adding a filter condition to
exclude null values of the product column, the query
now returns the desired 11 rows. The end result is a
query that performs all grouping against raw data in the
account table, and then embellishes the output using
data in three other tables, and without doing any joins.
As previously noted, scalar subqueries can also appear in
the order by clause. The following query retrieves
employee data sorted by the last name of each
employee’s boss, and then by the employee’s last name:
mysql> SELECT emp.emp_id, CONCAT(emp.fname, ' ', emp.lname)
emp_name,
-> (SELECT CONCAT(boss.fname, ' ', boss.lname)
-> FROM employee boss
-> WHERE boss.emp_id = emp.superior_emp_id) boss_name
-> FROM employee emp

-> WHERE emp.superior_emp_id IS NOT NULL
-> ORDER BY (SELECT boss.lname FROM employee boss
-> WHERE boss.emp_id = emp.superior_emp_id), emp.lname;
+--------+------------------+-----------------+

| 2 | Susan Barker | Michael Smith |
| 3 | Robert Tyler | Michael Smith |
| 4 | Susan Hawthorne | Robert Tyler |
+--------+------------------+-----------------+
17 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The query uses two correlated scalar subqueries: one in
the select clause to retrieve the full name of each
employee’s boss, and another in the order by clause to
return just the last name of each employee’s boss for
sorting purposes.
Along with using correlated scalar subqueries in select
statements, you can use noncorrelated scalar subqueries
to generate values for an insert statement. For example,
let’s say you are going to generate a new account row,
and you’ve been given the following data:
The product name (“savings account”)
The customer’s federal ID (“555-55-5555”)
The name of the branch where the account was
opened (“Quincy Branch”)
The first and last names of the teller who opened the
account (“Frank Portman”)
Before you can create a row in the account table, you
will need to look up the key values for all of these pieces
of data so that you can populate the foreign key columns
in the account table. You have two choices for how to go

about it: execute four queries to retrieve the primary key
values and place those values into an insert statement,
or use subqueries to retrieve the four key values from
within an insert statement. Here’s an example of the
latter approach:
INSERT INTO account
(account_id, product_cd, cust_id, open_date,
last_activity_date,
status, open_branch_id, open_emp_id, avail_balance,
pending_balance)
VALUES (NULL,
(SELECT product_cd FROM product WHERE name = 'savings
account'),
(SELECT cust_id FROM customer WHERE fed_id = '555-55-5555'),
'2008-09-25', '2008-09-25', 'ACTIVE',
(SELECT branch_id FROM branch WHERE name = 'Quincy Branch'),
(SELECT emp_id FROM employee WHERE lname = 'Portman' AND
fname = 'Frank'),
0, 0);
Using a single SQL statement, you can create a row in
the account table and look up four foreign key column
values at the same time. There is one downside to this
approach, however. When you use subqueries to
generate data for columns that allow null values, your
insert statement will succeed even if one of your
subqueries fails to return a value. For example, if you
mistyped Frank Portman’s name in the fourth subquery, a
row will still be created in account, but the open_emp_id
would be set to null.

Subquery Wrap-up
I covered a lot of ground in this chapter, so it might be a
good idea to review it. The examples I used in this
chapter demonstrated subqueries that:
Return a single column and row, a single column with
multiple rows, and multiple columns and rows
Are independent of the containing statement
(noncorrelated subqueries)
Reference one or more columns from the containing
statement (correlated subqueries)
Are used in conditions that utilize comparison
operators as well as the special-purpose operators
in, not in, exists, and not exists
Can be found in select, update, delete, and insert
statements
Generate result sets that can be joined to other
tables (or subqueries) in a query
Can be used to generate values to populate a table or
to populate columns in a query’s result set
Are used in the select, from, where, having, and
order by clauses of queries
Obviously, subqueries are a very versatile tool, so don’t
feel bad if all these concepts haven’t sunk in after
reading this chapter for the first time. Keep
experimenting with the various uses for subqueries, and
you will soon find yourself thinking about how you might
utilize a subquery every time you write a nontrivial SQL
statement.

Test Your Knowledge
These exercises are designed to test your understanding
of subqueries. Please see Appendix C for the solutions.
Exercise 9-1
Construct a query against the account table that uses a
filter condition with a noncorrelated subquery against
the product table to find all loan accounts
(product.product_type_cd = 'LOAN'). Retrieve the
account ID, product code, customer ID, and available
balance.
Exercise 9-2
Rework the query from Exercise 9-1 using a correlated
subquery against the product table to achieve the same
results.
Exercise 9-3
Join the following query to the employee table to show
the experience level of each employee:
SELECT 'trainee' name, '2004-01-01' start_dt, '2005-12-31'
end_dt
UNION ALL
SELECT 'worker' name, '2002-01-01' start_dt, '2003-12-31'
end_dt
UNION ALL
SELECT 'mentor' name, '2000-01-01' start_dt, '2001-12-31'
end_dt
Give the subquery the alias levels, and include the
employee ID, first name, last name, and experience level
(levels.name). (Hint: build a join condition using an
inequality condition to determine into which level the
employee.start_date column falls.)
Exercise 9-4
Construct a query against the employee table that
retrieves the employee ID, first name, and last name,
along with the names of the department and branch to
which the employee is assigned. Do not join any tables.

Chapter 10. Joins Revisited
By now, you should be comfortable with the concept of
the inner join, which I introduced in Chapter 5. This
chapter focuses on other ways in which you can join
tables, including the outer join and the cross join.
Outer Joins
In all the examples thus far that have included multiple
tables, we haven’t been concerned that the join
conditions might fail to find matches for all the rows in
the tables. For example, when joining the account table
to the customer table, I did not mention the possibility
that a value in the cust_id column of the account table
might not match a value in the cust_id column of the
customer table. If that were the case, then some of the
rows in one table or the other would be left out of the
result set.
Just to be sure, let’s check the data in the tables. Here
are the account_id and cust_id columns from the
account table:
mysql> SELECT account_id, cust_id
-> FROM account;
+------------+---------+
| account_id | cust_id |
+------------+---------+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 2 |
| 7 | 3 |
| 8 | 3 |
| 10 | 4 |
| 11 | 4 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 6 |
| 15 | 6 |
| 17 | 7 |
| 18 | 8 |
| 19 | 8 |
| 21 | 9 |
| 22 | 9 |
| 23 | 9 |
| 24 | 10 |

| 25 | 10 |
| 27 | 11 |
| 28 | 12 |
| 29 | 13 |
+------------+---------+
24 rows in set (1.50 sec)
There are 24 accounts spanning 13 different customers,
with customer IDs 1 through 13 having at least one
account. Here’s the set of customer IDs from the
customer table:
mysql> SELECT cust_id
-> FROM customer;
+---------+
| cust_id |
+---------+
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |
| 7 |
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
| 13 |
+---------+
13 rows in set (0.02 sec)
There are 13 rows in the customer table with IDs 1
through 13, so every customer ID is included at least
once in the account table. When the two tables are
joined on the cust_id column, therefore, you would
expect all 24 rows to be included in the result set
(barring any other filter conditions):
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, c.cust_id
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN customer c
-> ON a.cust_id = c.cust_id;
+------------+---------+
| account_id | cust_id |
+------------+---------+
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 2 |

| 7 | 3 |
| 8 | 3 |
| 10 | 4 |
| 11 | 4 |
| 12 | 4 |
| 13 | 5 |
| 14 | 6 |
| 15 | 6 |
| 17 | 7 |
| 18 | 8 |
| 19 | 8 |
| 21 | 9 |
| 22 | 9 |
| 23 | 9 |
| 24 | 10 |
| 25 | 10 |
| 27 | 11 |
| 28 | 12 |
| 29 | 13 |
+------------+---------+
24 rows in set (0.06 sec)
As expected, all 24 accounts are present in the result set.
But what happens if you join the account table to one of
the specialized customer tables, such as the business
table?
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, b.cust_id, b.name
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN business b
-> ON a.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+------------+---------+------------------------+
| account_id | cust_id | name |
+------------+---------+------------------------+
| 24 | 10 | Chilton Engineering |
| 25 | 10 | Chilton Engineering |
| 27 | 11 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 28 | 12 | Superior Auto Body |
| 29 | 13 | AAA Insurance Inc. |
+------------+---------+------------------------+
5 rows in set (0.10 sec)
Instead of 24 rows in the result set, there are now only
five. Let’s look in the business table to see why this is:
mysql> SELECT cust_id, name
-> FROM business;
+---------+------------------------+
| cust_id | name |
+---------+------------------------+
| 10 | Chilton Engineering |
| 11 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 12 | Superior Auto Body |
| 13 | AAA Insurance Inc. |

+---------+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
Of the 13 rows in the customer table, only four are
business customers, and since one of the business
customers has two accounts, a total of five rows in the
account table are linked to business customers.
But what if you want your query to return all the
accounts, but to include the business name only if the
account is linked to a business customer? This is an
example where you would need an outer join between
the account and business tables, as in:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, b.name
-> FROM account a LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON a.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+------------+---------+------------------------+
| account_id | cust_id | name |
+------------+---------+------------------------+

+------------+---------+------------------------+
24 rows in set (0.04 sec)
An outer join includes all of the rows from one table and
includes data from the second table only if matching
rows are found. In this case, all rows from the account
table are included, since I specified left outer join

and the account table is on the left side of the join
definition. The name column is null for all rows except
for the four business customers (cust_ids 10, 11, 12,
and 13). Here’s a similar query with an outer join to the
individual table instead of the business table:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, i.fname, i.lname
-> FROM account a LEFT OUTER JOIN individual i
-> ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id;
+------------+---------+----------+---------+
| account_id | cust_id | fname | lname |
+------------+---------+----------+---------+
| 1 | 1 | James | Hadley |

| 28 | 12 | NULL | NULL |
| 29 | 13 | NULL | NULL |
+------------+---------+----------+---------+
24 rows in set (0.09 sec)
This query is essentially the reverse of the previous
query: first and last names are supplied for the individual
customers, whereas the columns are null for the
business customers.
Left Versus Right Outer Joins
In each of the outer join examples in the previous
section, I specified left outer join. The keyword left
indicates that the table on the left side of the join is
responsible for determining the number of rows in the

result set, whereas the table on the right side is used to
provide column values whenever a match is found.
Consider the following query:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, b.name
-> FROM customer c LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON c.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+---------+------------------------+
| cust_id | name |
+---------+------------------------+
| 1 | NULL |
| 2 | NULL |
| 3 | NULL |
| 4 | NULL |
| 5 | NULL |
| 6 | NULL |
| 7 | NULL |
| 8 | NULL |
| 9 | NULL |
| 10 | Chilton Engineering |
| 11 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 12 | Superior Auto Body |
| 13 | AAA Insurance Inc. |
+---------+------------------------+
13 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The from clause specifies a left outer join, so all 13 rows
from the customer table are included in the result set,
with the business table contributing values to the
second column in the result set for the four business
customers. If you execute the same query, but indicate
right outer join, you would see the following results:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, b.name
-> FROM customer c RIGHT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON c.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+---------+------------------------+
| cust_id | name |
+---------+------------------------+
| 10 | Chilton Engineering |
| 11 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 12 | Superior Auto Body |
| 13 | AAA Insurance Inc. |
+---------+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The number of rows in the result set is now determined
by the number of rows in the business table, which is
why there are only four rows in the result set.
Keep in mind that both queries are performing outer
joins; the keywords left and right are there just to tell

the server which table is allowed to have gaps in the
data. If you want to outer-join tables A and B and you
want all rows from A with additional columns from B
whenever there is matching data, you can specify either
A left outer join B or B right outer join A.
Three-Way Outer Joins
In some cases, you may want to outer-join one table with
two other tables. For example, you may want a list of all
accounts showing either the customer’s first and last
names for individuals or the business name for business
customers, as in:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd,
-> CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname) person_name,
-> b.name business_name
-> FROM account a LEFT OUTER JOIN individual i
-> ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id
-> LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON a.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+------------+------------+-----------------+-----------------

24 rows in set (0.08 sec)
The results include all 24 rows from the account table,
along with either a person’s name or a business name
coming from the two outer-joined tables.
I don’t know of any restrictions with MySQL regarding
the number of tables that can be outer-joined to the same
table, but you can always use subqueries to limit the
number of joins in your query. For instance, you can
rewrite the previous example as follows:
mysql> SELECT account_ind.account_id, account_ind.product_cd,
-> account_ind.person_name,
-> b.name business_name
-> FROM
-> (SELECT a.account_id, a.product_cd, a.cust_id,
-> CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname) person_name
-> FROM account a LEFT OUTER JOIN individual i
-> ON a.cust_id = i.cust_id) account_ind
-> LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON account_ind.cust_id = b.cust_id;

24 rows in set (0.08 sec)
In this version of the query, the individual table is
outer-joined to the account table within a subquery
named account_ind, the results of which are then outer-
joined to the business table. Thus, each query (the
subquery and the containing query) uses only a single
outer join. If you are using a database other than MySQL,
you may need to utilize this strategy if you want to outer-
join more than one table.
Self Outer Joins
In Chapter 5, I introduced you to the concept of the self-
join, where a table is joined to itself. Here’s a self-join
example from Chapter 5, which joins the employee table
to itself to generate a list of employees and their
supervisors:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
-> e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
-> FROM employee e INNER JOIN employee e_mgr
-> ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| fname | lname | mgr_fname | mgr_lname |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Susan | Barker | Michael | Smith |
| Robert | Tyler | Michael | Smith |
| Susan | Hawthorne | Robert | Tyler |
| John | Gooding | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Helen | Fleming | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Chris | Tucker | Helen | Fleming |
| Sarah | Parker | Helen | Fleming |
| Jane | Grossman | Helen | Fleming |
| Paula | Roberts | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Thomas | Ziegler | Paula | Roberts |
| Samantha | Jameson | Paula | Roberts |
| John | Blake | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Cindy | Mason | John | Blake |
| Frank | Portman | John | Blake |
| Theresa | Markham | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Beth | Fowler | Theresa | Markham |
| Rick | Tulman | Theresa | Markham |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
17 rows in set (0.02 sec)
This query works fine except for one small issue:
employees who don’t have a supervisor are left out of the

result set. By changing the join from an inner join to an
outer join, however, the result set will include all
employees, including those without supervisors:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
-> e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
-> FROM employee e LEFT OUTER JOIN employee e_mgr
-> ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| fname | lname | mgr_fname | mgr_lname |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Michael | Smith | NULL | NULL |
| Susan | Barker | Michael | Smith |
| Robert | Tyler | Michael | Smith |
| Susan | Hawthorne | Robert | Tyler |
| John | Gooding | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Helen | Fleming | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Chris | Tucker | Helen | Fleming |
| Sarah | Parker | Helen | Fleming |
| Jane | Grossman | Helen | Fleming |
| Paula | Roberts | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Thomas | Ziegler | Paula | Roberts |
| Samantha | Jameson | Paula | Roberts |
| John | Blake | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Cindy | Mason | John | Blake |

| Theresa | Markham | Susan | Hawthorne |
| Beth | Fowler | Theresa | Markham |
| Rick | Tulman | Theresa | Markham |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
18 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The result set now includes Michael Smith, who is the
president of the bank and, therefore, does not have a
supervisor. The query utilizes a left outer join to generate
a list of all employees and, if applicable, their supervisor.
If you change the join to be a right outer join, you would
see the following results:
mysql> SELECT e.fname, e.lname,
-> e_mgr.fname mgr_fname, e_mgr.lname mgr_lname
-> FROM employee e RIGHT OUTER JOIN employee e_mgr
-> ON e.superior_emp_id = e_mgr.emp_id;
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| fname | lname | mgr_fname | mgr_lname |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| Susan | Barker | Michael | Smith |
| Robert | Tyler | Michael | Smith |
| NULL | NULL | Susan | Barker |
| Susan | Hawthorne | Robert | Tyler |

| NULL | NULL | Beth | Fowler |
| NULL | NULL | Rick | Tulman |
+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
28 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query shows each supervisor (still the third and
fourth columns) along with the set of employees he or
she supervises. Therefore, Michael Smith appears twice
as supervisor to Susan Barker and Robert Tyler; Susan
Barker appears once as a supervisor to nobody (null
values in the first and second columns). All 18 employees
appear at least once in the third and fourth columns,
with some appearing more than once if they supervise
more than one employee, making a total of 28 rows in the
result set. This is a very different outcome from the
previous query, and it was prompted by changing only a
single keyword (left to right). Therefore, when using
outer joins, make sure you think carefully about whether
to specify a left or right outer join.

Cross Joins
Back in Chapter 5, I introduced the concept of a
Cartesian product, which is essentially the result of
joining multiple tables without specifying any join
conditions. Cartesian products are used fairly frequently
by accident (e.g., forgetting to add the join condition to
the from clause) but are not so common otherwise. If,
however, you do intend to generate the Cartesian
product of two tables, you should specify a cross join, as
in:
mysql> SELECT pt.name, p.product_cd, p.name
-> FROM product p CROSS JOIN product_type pt;
+-------------------------------+------------+----------------
---------+
| name | product_cd | name

24 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This query generates the Cartesian product of the
product and product_type tables, resulting in 24 rows
(8 product rows × 3 product_type rows). But now that
you know what a cross join is and how to specify it, what
is it used for? Most SQL books will describe what a cross
join is and then tell you that it is seldom useful, but I
would like to share with you a situation in which I find
the cross join to be quite helpful.
In Chapter 9, I discussed how to use subqueries to
fabricate tables. The example I used showed how to build
a three-row table that could be joined to other tables.
Here’s the fabricated table from the example:
mysql> SELECT 'Small Fry' name, 0 low_limit, 4999.99
high_limit
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'Average Joes' name, 5000 low_limit, 9999.99
high_limit
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT 'Heavy Hitters' name, 10000 low_limit,
9999999.99 high_limit;
+---------------+-----------+------------+
| name | low_limit | high_limit |
+---------------+-----------+------------+
| Small Fry | 0 | 4999.99 |
| Average Joes | 5000 | 9999.99 |

| Heavy Hitters | 10000 | 9999999.99 |
+---------------+-----------+------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
While this table was exactly what was needed for placing
customers into three groups based on their aggregate
account balance, this strategy of merging single-row
tables using the set operator union all doesn’t work
very well if you need to fabricate a large table.
Say, for example, that you want to create a query that
generates a row for every day in the year 2008, but you
don’t have a table in your database that contains a row
for every day. Using the strategy from the example in
Chapter 9, you could do something like the following:
SELECT '2008-01-01' dt
UNION ALL
SELECT '2008-01-02' dt
UNION ALL
SELECT '2008-01-03' dt
UNION ALL
...
...
...
SELECT '2008-12-29' dt
UNION ALL
SELECT '2008-12-30' dt
UNION ALL
SELECT '2008-12-31' dt
Building a query that merges together the results of 366
queries is a bit tedious, so maybe a different strategy is
needed. What if you generate a table with 366 rows
(2008 was a leap year) with a single column containing a
number between 0 and 366, and then add that number of
days to January 1, 2008? Here’s one possible method to
generate such a table:
mysql> SELECT ones.num + tens.num + hundreds.num
-> FROM
-> (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 1 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 2 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 3 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 4 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 5 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 6 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 7 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 8 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 9 num) ones

-> CROSS JOIN
-> (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 10 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 20 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 30 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 40 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 50 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 60 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 70 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 80 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 90 num) tens
-> CROSS JOIN
-> (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 100 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 200 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 300 num) hundreds;
+------------------------------------+
| ones.num + tens.num + hundreds.num |
+------------------------------------+
| 0 |
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |
| 5 |
| 6 |
| 7 |
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 10 |
| 11 |
| 12 |
...
...
...
| 391 |
| 392 |
| 393 |
| 394 |
| 395 |
| 396 |
| 397 |
| 398 |
| 399 |
+------------------------------------+
400 rows in set (0.00 sec)
If you take the Cartesian product of the three sets {0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,
90}, and {0, 100, 200, 300} and add the values in the
three columns, you get a 400-row result set containing

all numbers between 0 and 399. While this is more than
the 366 rows needed to generate the set of days in 2008,
it’s easy enough to get rid of the excess rows, and I’ll
show you how shortly.
The next step is to convert the set of numbers to a set of
dates. To do this, I will use the date_add() function to
add each number in the result set to January 1, 2008.
Then I’ll add a filter condition to throw away any dates
that venture into 2009:
mysql> SELECT DATE_ADD('2008-01-01',

366 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The nice thing about this approach is that the result set
automatically includes the extra leap day (February 29)
without your intervention, since the database server
figures it out when it adds 59 days to January 1, 2008.
Now that you have a mechanism for fabricating all the
days in 2008, what should you do with it? Well, you might
be asked to generate a query that shows every day in
2008 along with the number of banking transactions
conducted on that day, the number of accounts opened

on that day, and so forth. Here’s an example that answers
the first question:
mysql> SELECT days.dt, COUNT(t.txn_id)
-> FROM transaction t RIGHT OUTER JOIN
-> (SELECT DATE_ADD('2008-01-01',
-> INTERVAL (ones.num + tens.num + hundreds.num) DAY)
dt
-> FROM
-> (SELECT 0 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 1 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 2 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 3 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 4 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 5 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 6 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 7 num UNION ALL
-> SELECT 8 num UNION ALL

<
-> '2009-01-01') days

366 rows in set (0.03 sec)
This is one of the more interesting queries thus far in the
book, in that it includes cross joins, outer joins, a date
function, grouping, set operations (union all), and an
aggregate function (count()). It is also not the most
elegant solution to the given problem, but it should serve
as an example of how, with a little creativity and a firm
grasp on the language, you can make even a seldom-used
feature like cross joins a potent tool in your SQL toolkit.

Natural Joins
If you are lazy (and aren’t we all), you can choose a join
type that allows you to name the tables to be joined but
lets the database server determine what the join
conditions need to be. Known as the natural join, this join
type relies on identical column names across multiple
tables to infer the proper join conditions. For example,
the account table includes a column named cust_id,
which is the foreign key to the customer table, whose
primary key is also named cust_id. Thus, you can write
a query that uses natural join to join the two tables:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, c.cust_type_cd,
c.fed_id
-> FROM account a NATURAL JOIN customer c;
+------------+---------+--------------+-------------+
| account_id | cust_id | cust_type_cd | fed_id |
+------------+---------+--------------+-------------+
| 1 | 1 | I | 111-11-1111 |
| 2 | 1 | I | 111-11-1111 |
| 3 | 1 | I | 111-11-1111 |
| 4 | 2 | I | 222-22-2222 |
| 5 | 2 | I | 222-22-2222 |
| 6 | 3 | I | 333-33-3333 |
| 7 | 3 | I | 333-33-3333 |
| 8 | 4 | I | 444-44-4444 |
| 9 | 4 | I | 444-44-4444 |
| 10 | 4 | I | 444-44-4444 |
| 11 | 5 | I | 555-55-5555 |
| 12 | 6 | I | 666-66-6666 |
| 13 | 6 | I | 666-66-6666 |
| 14 | 7 | I | 777-77-7777 |
| 15 | 8 | I | 888-88-8888 |

| 22 | 11 | B | 04-2222222 |

| 24 | 13 | B | 04-4444444 |
+------------+---------+--------------+-------------+
24 rows in set (0.02 sec)
Because you specified a natural join, the server inspected
the table definitions and added the join condition
a.cust_id = c.cust_id to join the two tables.

This is all well and good, but what if the columns don’t
have the same name across the tables? For example, the
account table also has a foreign key to the branch table,
but the column in the account table is named
open_branch_id instead of just branch_id. Let’s see
what happens if I use natural join between the
account and branch tables:
mysql> SELECT a.account_id, a.cust_id, a.open_branch_id,
b.name
-> FROM account a NATURAL JOIN branch b;
+------------+---------+----------------+---------------+
| account_id | cust_id | open_branch_id | name |

96 rows in set (0.07 sec)
It looks like something has gone wrong; the query should
return no more than 24 rows, since there are 24 rows in
the account table. What has happened is that, since the
server couldn’t find two identically named columns in the
two tables, no join condition was generated and the two
tables were cross-joined instead, resulting in 96 rows (24
accounts × 4 branches).
So, is the reduced wear and tear on the old fingers from
not having to type the join condition worth the trouble?
Absolutely not; you should avoid this join type and use
inner joins with explicit join conditions.

Test Your Knowledge
The following exercises test your understanding of outer
and cross joins. Please see Appendix C for solutions.
Exercise 10-1
Write a query that returns all product names along with
the accounts based on that product (use the product_cd
column in the account table to link to the product table).
Include all products, even if no accounts have been
opened for that product.
Exercise 10-2
Reformulate your query from Exercise 10-1 to use the
other outer join type (e.g., if you used a left outer join in
Exercise 10-1, use a right outer join this time) such that
the results are identical to Exercise 10-1.
Exercise 10-3
Outer-join the account table to both the individual and
business tables (via the account.cust_id column) such
that the result set contains one row per account.
Columns to include are account.account_id,
account.product_cd, individual.fname,
individual.lname, and business.name.
Exercise 10-4 (Extra Credit)
Devise a query that will generate the set {1, 2, 3,..., 99,
100}. (Hint: use a cross join with at least two from clause
subqueries.)

Chapter 11. Conditional Logic
In certain situations, you may want your SQL logic to
branch in one direction or another depending on the
values of certain columns or expressions. This chapter
focuses on how to write statements that can behave
differently depending on the data encountered during
statement execution.
What Is Conditional Logic?
Conditional logic is simply the ability to take one of
several paths during program execution. For example,
when querying customer information, you might want to
retrieve either the fname/lname columns from the
individual table or the name column from the business
table depending on what type of customer is
encountered. Using outer joins, you could return both
strings and let the caller figure out which one to use, as
in:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.fed_id, c.cust_type_cd,
-> CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname) indiv_name,
-> b.name business_name
-> FROM customer c LEFT OUTER JOIN individual i
-> ON c.cust_id = i.cust_id
-> LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON c.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+---------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+----
--------------------+
| cust_id | fed_id | cust_type_cd | indiv_name |
business_name |
+---------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+----
--------------------+
| 1 | 111-11-1111 | I | James Hadley |

+---------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+----
--------------------+
13 rows in set (0.13 sec)
The caller can look at the value of the cust_type_cd
column and decide whether to use the indiv_name or
business_name column. Instead, however, you could use
conditional logic via a case expression to determine the
type of customer and return the appropriate string, as in:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.fed_id,
-> CASE
-> WHEN c.cust_type_cd = 'I'
-> THEN CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname)
-> WHEN c.cust_type_cd = 'B'
-> THEN b.name
-> ELSE 'Unknown'
-> END name
-> FROM customer c LEFT OUTER JOIN individual i
-> ON c.cust_id = i.cust_id
-> LEFT OUTER JOIN business b
-> ON c.cust_id = b.cust_id;
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| cust_id | fed_id | name |
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| 1 | 111-11-1111 | James Hadley |
| 2 | 222-22-2222 | Susan Tingley |
| 3 | 333-33-3333 | Frank Tucker |
| 4 | 444-44-4444 | John Hayward |
| 5 | 555-55-5555 | Charles Frasier |
| 6 | 666-66-6666 | John Spencer |
| 7 | 777-77-7777 | Margaret Young |
| 8 | 888-88-8888 | Louis Blake |
| 9 | 999-99-9999 | Richard Farley |
| 10 | 04-1111111 | Chilton Engineering |
| 11 | 04-2222222 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 12 | 04-3333333 | Superior Auto Body |
| 13 | 04-4444444 | AAA Insurance Inc. |
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
13 rows in set (0.00 sec)

This version of the query returns a single name column
that is generated by the case expression starting on the
second line of the query, which, in this example, checks
the value of the cust_type_cd column and returns either
the individual’s first/last names or the business name.

The Case Expression
All of the major database servers include built-in
functions designed to mimic the if-then-else statement
found in most programming languages (examples include
Oracle’s decode() function, MySQL’s if() function, and
SQL Server’s coalesce() function). Case expressions are
also designed to facilitate if-then-else logic but enjoy two
advantages over built-in functions:
The case expression is part of the SQL standard
(SQL92 release) and has been implemented by
Oracle Database, SQL Server, MySQL, Sybase,
PostgreSQL, IBM UDB, and others.
Case expressions are built into the SQL grammar and
can be included in select, insert, update, and
delete statements.
The next two subsections introduce the two different
types of case expressions, and then I show you some
examples of case expressions in action.
Searched Case Expressions
The case expression demonstrated earlier in the chapter
is an example of a searched case expression, which has
the following syntax:
CASE
WHEN C1 THEN E1
WHEN C2 THEN E2
...
WHEN CN THEN EN
[ELSE ED]
END
In the previous definition, the symbols C1, C2,..., CN
represent conditions, and the symbols E1, E2,..., EN
represent expressions to be returned by the case
expression. If the condition in a when clause evaluates to
true, then the case expression returns the corresponding
expression. Additionally, the ED symbol represents the
default expression, which the case expression returns if
none of the conditions C1, C2,..., CN evaluate to true (the
else clause is optional, which is why it is enclosed in
square brackets). All the expressions returned by the

various when clauses must evaluate to the same type
(e.g., date, number, varchar).
Here’s an example of a searched case expression:
CASE
WHEN employee.title = 'Head Teller'
THEN 'Head Teller'
WHEN employee.title = 'Teller'
AND YEAR(employee.start_date) > 2007
THEN 'Teller Trainee'
WHEN employee.title = 'Teller'
AND YEAR(employee.start_date) < 2006
THEN 'Experienced Teller'
WHEN employee.title = 'Teller'
THEN 'Teller'
ELSE 'Non-Teller'
END
This case expression returns a string that can be used to
determine hourly pay scales, print name badges, and so
forth. When the case expression is evaluated, the when
clauses are evaluated in order from top to bottom; as
soon as one of the conditions in a when clause evaluates
to true, the corresponding expression is returned and
any remaining when clauses are ignored. If none of the
when clause conditions evaluate to true, then the
expression in the else clause is returned.
Although the previous example returns string
expressions, keep in mind that case expressions may
return any type of expression, including subqueries.
Here’s another version of the individual/business name
query from earlier in the chapter that uses subqueries
instead of outer joins to retrieve data from the
individual and business tables:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.fed_id,
-> CASE
-> WHEN c.cust_type_cd = 'I' THEN
-> (SELECT CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname)
-> FROM individual i
-> WHERE i.cust_id = c.cust_id)
-> WHEN c.cust_type_cd = 'B' THEN
-> (SELECT b.name
-> FROM business b
-> WHERE b.cust_id = c.cust_id)
-> ELSE 'Unknown'
-> END name
-> FROM customer c;

+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| cust_id | fed_id | name |
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| 1 | 111-11-1111 | James Hadley |
| 2 | 222-22-2222 | Susan Tingley |
| 3 | 333-33-3333 | Frank Tucker |
| 4 | 444-44-4444 | John Hayward |
| 5 | 555-55-5555 | Charles Frasier |
| 6 | 666-66-6666 | John Spencer |
| 7 | 777-77-7777 | Margaret Young |
| 8 | 888-88-8888 | Louis Blake |
| 9 | 999-99-9999 | Richard Farley |
| 10 | 04-1111111 | Chilton Engineering |
| 11 | 04-2222222 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 12 | 04-3333333 | Superior Auto Body |
| 13 | 04-4444444 | AAA Insurance Inc. |
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
13 rows in set (0.01 sec)
This version of the query includes only the customer
table in the from clause and uses correlated subqueries
to retrieve the appropriate name for each customer. I
prefer this version over the outer join version from
earlier in the chapter, since the server reads from the
individual and business tables only as needed instead
of always joining all three tables.
Simple Case Expressions
The simple case expression is quite similar to the
searched case expression but is a bit less flexible. Here’s
the syntax:
CASE V0
WHEN V1 THEN E1
WHEN V2 THEN E2
...
WHEN VN THEN EN
[ELSE ED]
END
In the preceding definition, V0 represents a value, and
the symbols V1, V2,..., VN represent values that are to be
compared to V0. The symbols E1, E2,..., EN represent
expressions to be returned by the case expression, and
ED represents the expression to be returned if none of
the values in the set V1, V2,..., VN match the V0 value.
Here’s an example of a simple case expression:
CASE customer.cust_type_cd
WHEN 'I' THEN

(SELECT CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname)
FROM individual I
WHERE i.cust_id = customer.cust_id)
WHEN 'B' THEN
(SELECT b.name
FROM business b
WHERE b.cust_id = customer.cust_id)
ELSE 'Unknown Customer Type'
END
Simple case expressions are less powerful than searched
case expressions because you can’t specify your own
conditions; instead, equality conditions are built for you.
To show you what I mean, here’s a searched case
expression having the same logic as the previous simple
case expression:
CASE
WHEN customer.cust_type_cd = 'I' THEN
(SELECT CONCAT(i.fname, ' ', i.lname)
FROM individual I
WHERE i.cust_id = customer.cust_id)
WHEN customer.cust_type_cd = 'B' THEN
(SELECT b.name
FROM business b
WHERE b.cust_id = customer.cust_id)
ELSE 'Unknown Customer Type'
END
With searched case expressions, you can build range
conditions, inequality conditions, and multipart
conditions using and/or/not, so I would recommend using
searched case expressions for all but the simplest logic.

Case Expression Examples
The following sections present a variety of examples
illustrating the utility of conditional logic in SQL
statements.
Result Set Transformations
You may have run into a situation where you are
performing aggregations over a finite set of values, such
as days of the week, but you want the result set to
contain a single row with one column per value instead
of one row per value. As an example, let’s say you have
been asked to write a query that shows the number of
accounts opened in the years 2000 through 2005:
mysql> SELECT YEAR(open_date) year, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> WHERE open_date > '1999-12-31'
-> AND open_date < '2006-01-01'
-> GROUP BY YEAR(open_date);
+------+----------+
| year | how_many |
+------+----------+
| 2000 | 3 |
| 2001 | 4 |
| 2002 | 5 |
| 2003 | 3 |
| 2004 | 9 |
+------+----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
However, you have also been instructed to return a
single row of data with six columns (one for each year in
the data range). To transform this result set into a single
row, you will need to create six columns and, within each
column, sum only those rows pertaining to the year in
question:
mysql> SELECT
-> SUM(CASE
-> WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2000 THEN 1
-> ELSE 0
-> END) year_2000,
-> SUM(CASE
-> WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2001 THEN 1
-> ELSE 0
-> END) year_2001,
-> SUM(CASE
-> WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2002 THEN 1

-> ELSE 0
-> END) year_2002,
-> SUM(CASE
-> WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2003 THEN 1
-> ELSE 0
-> END) year_2003,
-> SUM(CASE
-> WHEN EXTRACT(YEAR FROM open_date) = 2004 THEN 1
-> ELSE 0

Each of the six columns in the previous query are
identical, except for the year value. When the extract()
function returns the desired year for that column, the
case expression returns the value 1; otherwise, it returns
a 0. When summed over all accounts opened since 2000,
each column returns the number of accounts opened for
that year. Obviously, such transformations are practical
for only a small number of values; generating one column
for each year since 1905 would quickly become tedious.
Note ✎
Although it is a bit advanced for this book, it is worth
pointing out that both SQL Server and Oracle
Database 11g include PIVOT clauses specifically for
these types of queries.
Selective Aggregation
Back in Chapter 9, I showed a partial solution for an
example that demonstrated how to find accounts whose

account balances don’t agree with the raw data in the
transaction table. The reason for the partial solution
was that a full solution requires the use of conditional
logic, so all the pieces are now in place to finish the job.
Here’s where I left off in Chapter 9:
SELECT CONCAT('ALERT! : Account #', a.account_id,
' Has Incorrect Balance!')
FROM account a
WHERE (a.avail_balance, a.pending_balance) <>
(SELECT SUM(<expression to generate available balance>),
SUM(<expression to generate pending balance>)
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id);
The query uses a correlated subquery on the
transaction table to sum together the individual
transactions for a given account. When summing
transactions, you need to consider the following two
issues:
Transaction amounts are always positive, so you need
to look at the transaction type to see whether the
transaction is a debit or a credit and flip the sign
(multiply by −1) for debit transactions.
If the date in the funds_avail_date column is
greater than the current day, the transaction should
be added to the pending balance total but not to the
available balance total.
While some transactions need to be excluded from the
available balance, all transactions are included in the
pending balance, making it the simpler of the two
calculations. Here’s the case expression used to calculate
the pending balance:
CASE
WHEN transaction.txn_type_cd = 'DBT'
THEN transaction.amount * −1
ELSE transaction.amount
END
Thus, all transaction amounts are multiplied by −1 for
debit transactions and are left as is for credit
transactions. This same logic applies to the available
balance calculation as well, but only transactions that
have become available should be included. Therefore, the

case expression used to calculate available balance
includes one additional when clause:
CASE
WHEN transaction.funds_avail_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
THEN 0
WHEN transaction.txn_type_cd = 'DBT'
THEN transaction.amount * −1
ELSE transaction.amount
END
With the first when clause in place, unavailable funds,
such as checks that have not cleared, will contribute $0
to the sum. Here’s the final query with the two case
expressions in place:
SELECT CONCAT('ALERT! : Account #', a.account_id,
' Has Incorrect Balance!')
FROM account a
WHERE (a.avail_balance, a.pending_balance) <>
(SELECT
SUM(CASE
WHEN t.funds_avail_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
THEN 0
WHEN t.txn_type_cd = 'DBT'
THEN t.amount * −1
ELSE t.amount
END),
SUM(CASE
WHEN t.txn_type_cd = 'DBT'
THEN t.amount * −1
ELSE t.amount
END)
FROM transaction t
WHERE t.account_id = a.account_id);
By using conditional logic, the sum() aggregate functions
are being fed manipulated data by the two case
expressions, allowing the appropriate amounts to be
summed.
Checking for Existence
Sometimes you will want to determine whether a
relationship exists between two entities without regard
for the quantity. For example, you might want to know
whether a customer has any checking or savings
accounts, but you don’t care whether a customer has
more than one of each type of account. Here’s a query
that uses multiple case expressions to generate two

output columns, one to show whether the customer has
any checking accounts and the other to show whether
the customer has any savings accounts:
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.fed_id, c.cust_type_cd,
-> CASE
-> WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM account a
-> WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> AND a.product_cd = 'CHK') THEN 'Y'
-> ELSE 'N'
-> END has_checking,
-> CASE
-> WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM account a
-> WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id
-> AND a.product_cd = 'SAV') THEN 'Y'
-> ELSE 'N'
-> END has_savings
-> FROM customer c;
+---------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------
------+
| cust_id | fed_id | cust_type_cd | has_checking |
has_savings |
+---------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------
------+
| 1 | 111-11-1111 | I | Y | Y
|
| 2 | 222-22-2222 | I | Y | Y
|
| 3 | 333-33-3333 | I | Y | N
|
| 4 | 444-44-4444 | I | Y | Y
|
| 5 | 555-55-5555 | I | Y | N
|
| 6 | 666-66-6666 | I | Y | N
|
| 7 | 777-77-7777 | I | N | N
|
| 8 | 888-88-8888 | I | Y | Y
|
| 9 | 999-99-9999 | I | Y | N
|
| 10 | 04-1111111 | B | Y | N
|
| 11 | 04-2222222 | B | N | N
|
| 12 | 04-3333333 | B | Y | N
|
| 13 | 04-4444444 | B | N | N
|
+---------+-------------+--------------+--------------+-------

13 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Each case expression includes a correlated subquery
against the account table; one looks for checking
accounts, the other for savings accounts. Since each
when clause uses the exists operator, the conditions
evaluate to true as long as the customer has at least one
of the desired accounts.
In other cases, you may care how many rows are
encountered, but only up to a point. For example, the
next query uses a simple case expression to count the
number of accounts for each customer, and then returns
either 'None', '1', '2', or '3+':
mysql> SELECT c.cust_id, c.fed_id, c.cust_type_cd,
-> CASE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM account a
-> WHERE a.cust_id = c.cust_id)
-> WHEN 0 THEN 'None'
-> WHEN 1 THEN '1'
-> WHEN 2 THEN '2'
-> ELSE '3+'
-> END num_accounts
-> FROM customer c;
+---------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| cust_id | fed_id | cust_type_cd | num_accounts |
+---------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1 | 111-11-1111 | I | 3+ |
| 2 | 222-22-2222 | I | 2 |
| 3 | 333-33-3333 | I | 2 |
| 4 | 444-44-4444 | I | 3+ |
| 5 | 555-55-5555 | I | 1 |
| 6 | 666-66-6666 | I | 2 |
| 7 | 777-77-7777 | I | 1 |
| 8 | 888-88-8888 | I | 2 |
| 9 | 999-99-9999 | I | 3+ |
| 10 | 04-1111111 | B | 2 |
| 11 | 04-2222222 | B | 1 |
| 12 | 04-3333333 | B | 1 |
| 13 | 04-4444444 | B | 1 |
+---------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
13 rows in set (0.01 sec)
For this query, I didn’t want to differentiate between
customers having more than two accounts, so the case
expression simply creates a '3+' category. Such a query
might be useful if you were looking for customers to
contact regarding opening a new account with the bank.

Division-by-Zero Errors
When performing calculations that include division, you
should always take care to ensure that the denominators
are never equal to zero. Whereas some database servers,
such as Oracle Database, will throw an error when a zero
denominator is encountered, MySQL simply sets the
result of the calculation to null, as demonstrated by the
following:
mysql> SELECT 100 / 0;
+---------+
| 100 / 0 |
+---------+
| NULL |
+---------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
To safeguard your calculations from encountering errors
or, even worse, from being mysteriously set to null, you
should wrap all denominators in conditional logic, as
demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT a.cust_id, a.product_cd, a.avail_balance /
-> CASE
-> WHEN prod_tots.tot_balance = 0 THEN 1
-> ELSE prod_tots.tot_balance
-> END percent_of_total
-> FROM account a INNER JOIN
-> (SELECT a.product_cd, SUM(a.avail_balance) tot_balance
-> FROM account a
-> GROUP BY a.product_cd) prod_tots
-> ON a.product_cd = prod_tots.product_cd;
+---------+------------+------------------+
| cust_id | product_cd | percent_of_total |

| 11 | BUS | 1.000000 |
| 1 | CD | 0.153846 |

| 2 | SAV | 0.107773 |
| 4 | SAV | 0.413723 |
| 8 | SAV | 0.209073 |
| 13 | SBL | 1.000000 |
+---------+------------+------------------+
24 rows in set (0.13 sec)
This query computes the ratio of each account balance to
the total balance for all accounts of the same product
type. Since some product types, such as business loans,
could have a total balance of zero if all loans were
currently paid in full, it is best to include the case
expression to ensure that the denominator is never zero.
Conditional Updates
When updating rows in a table, you sometimes need to
decide what values to set certain columns to. For
example, after inserting a new transaction, you need to
modify the avail_balance, pending_balance, and
last_activity_date columns in the account table.
Although the last two columns are easily updated, to
correctly modify the avail_balance column you need to
know whether the funds from the transaction are
immediately available by checking the
funds_avail_date column in the transaction table.
Given that transaction ID 999 has just been inserted, you
can use the following update statement to modify the
three columns in the account table:
1 UPDATE account
2 SET last_activity_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
3 pending_balance = pending_balance +
4 (SELECT t.amount *
5 CASE t.txn_type_cd WHEN 'DBT' THEN −1 ELSE 1 END
6 FROM transaction t
7 WHERE t.txn_id = 999),
8 avail_balance = avail_balance +
9 (SELECT
10 CASE
11 WHEN t.funds_avail_date > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
THEN 0
12 ELSE t.amount *

13 CASE t.txn_type_cd WHEN 'DBT' THEN −1 ELSE 1
END
14 END
15 FROM transaction t
16 WHERE t.txn_id = 999)
17 WHERE account.account_id =
18 (SELECT t.account_id
19 FROM transaction t
20 WHERE t.txn_id = 999);
This statement contains a total of three case expressions
: two of them (lines 5 and 13) are used to flip the sign on
the transaction amount for debit transactions, and the
third case expression (line 10) is used to check the funds
availability date. If the date is in the future, then zero is
added to the available balance; otherwise, the
transaction amount is added.
Handling Null Values
While null values are the appropriate thing to store in a
table if the value for a column is unknown, it is not
always appropriate to retrieve null values for display or
to take part in expressions. For example, you might want
to display the word unknown on a data entry screen
rather than leaving a field blank. When retrieving the
data, you can use a case expression to substitute the
string if the value is null, as in:
SELECT emp_id, fname, lname,
CASE
WHEN title IS NULL THEN 'Unknown'
ELSE title
END
FROM employee;
For calculations, null values often cause a null result,
as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SELECT (7 * 5) / ((3 + 14) * null);
+-----------------------------+
| (7 * 5) / ((3 + 14) * null) |
+-----------------------------+
| NULL |
+-----------------------------+
1 row in set (0.08 sec)
When performing calculations, case expressions are
useful for translating a null value into a number (usually
0 or 1) that will allow the calculation to yield a non-null

value. If you are performing a calculation that includes
the account.avail_balance column, for example, you
could substitute a 0 (if doing addition or subtraction) or a
1 (if doing multiplication or division) for those accounts
that have been established but haven’t yet been funded:
SELECT <some calculation> +
CASE
WHEN avail_balance IS NULL THEN 0
ELSE avail_balance
END
+ <rest of calculation>
...
If a numeric column is allowed to contain null values, it
is generally a good idea to use conditional logic in any
calculations that include the column so that the results
are usable.

Test Your Knowledge
Challenge your ability to work through conditional logic
problems with the examples that follow. When you’re
done, compare your solutions with those in Appendix C.
Exercise 11-1
Rewrite the following query, which uses a simple case
expression, so that the same results are achieved using a
searched case expression. Try to use as few when clauses
as possible.
SELECT emp_id,
CASE title
WHEN 'President' THEN 'Management'
WHEN 'Vice President' THEN 'Management'
WHEN 'Treasurer' THEN 'Management'
WHEN 'Loan Manager' THEN 'Management'
WHEN 'Operations Manager' THEN 'Operations'
WHEN 'Head Teller' THEN 'Operations'
WHEN 'Teller' THEN 'Operations'
ELSE 'Unknown'
END
FROM employee;

Chapter 12. Transactions
All of the examples thus far in this book have been
individual, independent SQL statements. While this may
be the norm for ad hoc reporting or data maintenance
scripts, application logic will frequently include multiple
SQL statements that need to execute together as a
logical unit of work. This chapter explores the need and
the infrastructure necessary to execute multiple SQL
statements concurrently.
Multiuser Databases
Database management systems allow not only a single
user to query and modify data, but multiple people to do
so simultaneously. If every user is only executing queries,
such as might be the case with a data warehouse during
normal business hours, then there are very few issues for
the database server to deal with. If some of the users are
adding and/or modifying data, however, the server must
handle quite a bit more bookkeeping.
Let’s say, for example, that you are running a report that
shows the available balance for all the checking accounts
opened at your branch. At the same time you are running
the report, however, the following activities are
occurring:
A teller at your branch is handling a deposit for one
of your customers.
A customer is finishing a withdrawal at the ATM in
the front lobby.
The bank’s month-end application is applying interest
to the accounts.
While your report is running, therefore, multiple users
are modifying the underlying data, so what numbers
should appear on the report? The answer depends
somewhat on how your server handles locking, which is
described in the next section.
Locking
Locks are the mechanism the database server uses to
control simultaneous use of data resources. When some

portion of the database is locked, any other users
wishing to modify (or possibly read) that data must wait
until the lock has been released. Most database servers
use one of two locking strategies:
Database writers must request and receive from the
server a write lock to modify data, and database
readers must request and receive from the server a
read lock to query data. While multiple users can
read data simultaneously, only one write lock is given
out at a time for each table (or portion thereof), and
read requests are blocked until the write lock is
released.
Database writers must request and receive from the
server a write lock to modify data, but readers do not
need any type of lock to query data. Instead, the
server ensures that a reader sees a consistent view of
the data (the data seems the same even though other
users may be making modifications) from the time
her query begins until her query has finished. This
approach is known as versioning.
There are pros and cons to both approaches. The first
approach can lead to long wait times if there are many
concurrent read and write requests, and the second
approach can be problematic if there are long-running
queries while data is being modified. Of the three servers
discussed in this book, Microsoft SQL Server uses the
first approach, Oracle Database uses the second
approach, and MySQL uses both approaches (depending
on your choice of storage engine, which we’ll discuss a
bit later in the chapter).
Lock Granularities
There are also a number of different strategies that you
may employ when deciding how to lock a resource. The
server may apply a lock at one of three different levels,
or granularities:
Table locks
Keep multiple users from modifying data in the same
table simultaneously

Page locks
Keep multiple users from modifying data on the same
page (a page is a segment of memory generally in the
range of 2 KB to 16 KB) of a table simultaneously
Row locks
Keep multiple users from modifying the same row in a
table simultaneously
Again, there are pros and cons to these approaches. It
takes very little bookkeeping to lock entire tables, but
this approach quickly yields unacceptable wait times as
the number of users increases. On the other hand, row
locking takes quite a bit more bookkeeping, but it allows
many users to modify the same table as long as they are
interested in different rows. Of the three servers
discussed in this book, Microsoft SQL Server uses page,
row, and table locking, Oracle Database uses only row
locking, and MySQL uses table, page, or row locking
(depending, again, on your choice of storage engine).
SQL Server will, under certain circumstances, escalate
locks from row to page, and from page to table, whereas
Oracle Database will never escalate locks.
To get back to your report, the data that appears on the
pages of the report will mirror either the state of the
database when your report started (if your server uses a
versioning approach) or the state of the database when
the server issues the reporting application a read lock (if
your server uses both read and write locks).

What Is a Transaction?
If database servers enjoyed 100% uptime, if users always
allowed programs to finish executing, and if applications
always completed without encountering fatal errors that
halt execution, then there would be nothing left to
discuss regarding concurrent database access. However,
we can rely on none of these things, so one more element
is necessary to allow multiple users to access the same
data.
This extra piece of the concurrency puzzle is the
transaction, which is a device for grouping together
multiple SQL statements such that either all or none of
the statements succeed (a property known as atomicity).
If you attempt to transfer $500 from your savings
account to your checking account, you would be a bit
upset if the money were successfully withdrawn from
your savings account but never made it to your checking
account. Whatever the reason for the failure (the server
was shut down for maintenance, the request for a page
lock on the account table timed out, etc.), you want your
$500 back.
To protect against this kind of error, the program that
handles your transfer request would first begin a
transaction, then issue the SQL statements needed to
move the money from your savings to your checking
account, and, if everything succeeds, end the transaction
by issuing the commit command. If something
unexpected happens, however, the program would issue
a rollback command, which instructs the server to undo
all changes made since the transaction began. The entire
process might look something like the following:
START TRANSACTION;
/* withdraw money from first account, making sure balance is
sufficient */
UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 9988
AND avail_balance > 500;
IF <exactly one row was updated by the previous statement>

THEN
/* deposit money into second account */
UPDATE account SET avail_balance = avail_balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 9989;
IF <exactly one row was updated by the previous statement>
THEN
/* everything worked, make the changes permanent */
COMMIT;
ELSE
/* something went wrong, undo all changes in this
transaction */
ROLLBACK;
END IF;
ELSE
/* insufficient funds, or error encountered during update */
ROLLBACK;
END IF;
Note ✎
While the previous code block may look similar to
one of the procedural languages provided by the
major database companies, such as Oracle’s PL/SQL
or Microsoft’s Transact-SQL, it is written in
pseudocode and does not attempt to mimic any
particular language.
The previous code block begins by starting a transaction
and then attempts to remove $500 from the checking
account and add it to the savings account. If all goes
well, the transaction is committed; if anything goes awry,
however, the transaction is rolled back, meaning that all
data changes since the beginning of the transaction are
undone.
By using a transaction, the program ensures that your
$500 either stays in your savings account or moves to
your checking account, without the possibility of it falling
into a crack. Regardless of whether the transaction was
committed or was rolled back, all resources acquired
(e.g., write locks) during the execution of the transaction
are released when the transaction completes.
Of course, if the program manages to complete both
update statements but the server shuts down before a
commit or rollback can be executed, then the
transaction will be rolled back when the server comes

back online. (One of the tasks that a database server
must complete before coming online is to find any
incomplete transactions that were underway when the
server shut down and to roll them back.) Additionally, if
your program finishes a transaction and issues a commit,
but the server shuts down before the changes have been
applied to permanent storage (i.e., the modified data is
sitting in memory but has not been flushed to disk), then
the database server must reapply the changes from your
transaction when the server is restarted (a property
known as durability).
Starting a Transaction
Database servers handle transaction creation in one of
two ways:
An active transaction is always associated with a
database session, so there is no need or method to
explicitly begin a transaction. When the current
transaction ends, the server automatically begins a
new transaction for your session.
Unless you explicitly begin a transaction, individual
SQL statements are automatically committed
independently of one another. To begin a transaction,
you must first issue a command.
Of the three servers, Oracle Database takes the first
approach, while Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL take
the second approach. One of the advantages of Oracle’s
approach to transactions is that, even if you are issuing
only a single SQL command, you have the ability to roll
back the changes if you don’t like the outcome or if you
change your mind. Thus, if you forget to add a where
clause to your delete statement, you will have the
opportunity to undo the damage (assuming you’ve had
your morning coffee and realize that you didn’t mean to
delete all 125,000 rows in your table). With MySQL and
SQL Server, however, once you press the Enter key, the
changes brought about by your SQL statement will be
permanent (unless your DBA can retrieve the original
data from a backup or from some other means).

The SQL:2003 standard includes a start transaction
command to be used when you want to explicitly begin a
transaction. While MySQL conforms to the standard, SQL
Server users must instead issue the command begin
transaction. With both servers, until you explicitly
begin a transaction, you are in what is known as auto-
commit mode, which means that individual statements
are automatically committed by the server. You can,
therefore, decide that you want to be in a transaction and
issue a start/begin transaction command, or you can
simply let the server commit individual statements.
Both MySQL and SQL Server allow you to turn off auto-
commit mode for individual sessions, in which case, the
servers will act just like Oracle Database regarding
transactions. With SQL Server, you issue the following
command to disable auto-commit mode:
SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS ON
MySQL allows you to disable auto-commit mode via the
following:
SET AUTOCOMMIT=0
Once you have left auto-commit mode, all SQL commands
take place within the scope of a transaction and must be
explicitly committed or rolled back.
Note ✎
A word of advice: shut off auto-commit mode each
time you log in, and get in the habit of running all of
your SQL statements within a transaction. If nothing
else, it may save you the embarrassment of having to
ask your DBA to reconstruct data that you have
inadvertently deleted.
Ending a Transaction
Once a transaction has begun, whether explicitly via the
start transaction command or implicitly by the
database server, you must explicitly end your transaction
for your changes to become permanent. You do this by
way of the commit command, which instructs the server
to mark the changes as permanent and release any

resources (i.e., page or row locks) used during the
transaction.
If you decide that you want to undo all the changes made
since starting the transaction, you must issue the
rollback command, which instructs the server to return
the data to its pretransaction state. After the rollback
has been completed, any resources used by your session
are released.
Along with issuing either the commit or rollback
command, there are several other scenarios by which
your transaction can end, either as an indirect result of
your actions or as a result of something outside your
control:
The server shuts down, in which case, your
transaction will be rolled back automatically when
the server is restarted.
You issue an SQL schema statement, such as alter
table, which will cause the current transaction to be
committed and a new transaction to be started.
You issue another start transaction command,
which will cause the previous transaction to be
committed.
The server prematurely ends your transaction
because the server detects a deadlock and decides
that your transaction is the culprit. In this case, the
transaction will be rolled back and you will receive
an error message.
Of these four scenarios, the first and third are fairly
straightforward, but the other two merit some
discussion. As far as the second scenario is concerned,
alterations to a database, whether it be the addition of a
new table or index or the removal of a column from a
table, cannot be rolled back, so commands that alter your
schema must take place outside a transaction. If a
transaction is currently underway, therefore, the server
will commit your current transaction, execute the SQL
schema statement command(s), and then automatically
start a new transaction for your session. The server will

not inform you of what has happened, so you should be
careful that the statements that comprise a unit of work
are not inadvertently broken up into multiple
transactions by the server.
The fourth scenario deals with deadlock detection. A
deadlock occurs when two different transactions are
waiting for resources that the other transaction currently
holds. For example, transaction A might have just
updated the account table and is waiting for a write lock
on the transaction table, while transaction B has
inserted a row into the transaction table and is waiting
for a write lock on the account table. If both transactions
happen to be modifying the same page or row
(depending on the lock granularity in use by the
database server), then they will each wait forever for the
other transaction to finish and free up the needed
resource. Database servers must always be on the
lookout for these situations so that throughput doesn’t
grind to a halt; when a deadlock is detected, one of the
transactions is chosen (either arbitrarily or by some
criteria) to be rolled back so that the other transaction
may proceed. Most of the time, the terminated
transaction can be restarted and will succeed without
encountering another deadlock situation.
Unlike the second scenario discussed earlier, the
database server will raise an error to inform you that
your transaction has been rolled back due to deadlock
detection. With MySQL, for example, you will receive
error #1213, which carries the following message:
Message: Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try
restarting transaction
As the error message suggests, it is a reasonable
practice to retry a transaction that has been rolled back
due to deadlock detection. However, if deadlocks become
fairly common, then you may need to modify the
applications that access the database to decrease the
probability of deadlocks (one common strategy is to
ensure that data resources are always accessed in the

same order, such as always modifying account data
before inserting transaction data).
Transaction Savepoints
In some cases, you may encounter an issue within a
transaction that requires a rollback, but you may not
want to undo all of the work that has transpired. For
these situations, you can establish one or more
savepoints within a transaction and use them to roll back
to a particular location within your transaction rather
than rolling all the way back to the start of the
transaction.
Choosing a Storage Engine
When using Oracle Database or Microsoft SQL Server,
a single set of code is responsible for low-level
database operations, such as retrieving a particular
row from a table based on primary key value. The
MySQL server, however, has been designed so that
multiple storage engines may be utilized to provide
low-level database functionality, including resource
locking and transaction management. As of version 6.0,
MySQL includes the following storage engines:
MyISAM
A nontransactional engine employing table locking
MEMORY
A nontransactional engine used for in-memory
tables
BDB
A transactional engine employing page-level locking
InnoDB
A transactional engine employing row-level locking
Merge
A specialty engine used to make multiple identical
MyISAM tables appear as a single table (a.k.a. table
partitioning)
Maria
A MyISAM replacement included in version 6.0.6
that adds full recovery capabilities
Falcon

A new (as of 6.0.4) high-performance transactional
engine employing row-level locking
Archive
A specialty engine used to store large amounts of
unindexed data, mainly for archival purposes
Although you might think that you would be forced to
choose a single storage engine for your database,
MySQL is flexible enough to allow you to choose a
storage engine on a table-by-table basis. For any tables
that might take part in transactions, however, you
should choose the InnoDB or Falcon storage engine,
which uses row-level locking and versioning to provide
the highest level of concurrency across the different
storage engines.
You may explicitly specify a storage engine when
creating a table, or you can change an existing table to
use a different engine. If you do not know what engine
is assigned to a table, you can use the show table
command, as demonstrated by the following:
mysql> SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'transaction' \G
*************************** 1. row
***************************
Name: transaction
Engine: InnoDB
Version: 10
Row_format: Compact
Rows: 21
Avg_row_length: 780

Update_time: NULL
Check_time: NULL
Collation: latin1_swedish_ci
Checksum: NULL
Create_options:
Comment:
1 row in set (1.46 sec)
Looking at the second item, you can see that the
transaction table is already using the InnoDB engine. If

it were not, you could assign the InnoDB engine to the
transaction table via the following command:
ALTER TABLE transaction ENGINE = INNODB;
All savepoints must be given a name, which allows you to
have multiple savepoints within a single transaction. To
create a savepoint named my_savepoint, you can do the
following:
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
To roll back to a particular savepoint, you simply issue
the rollback command followed by the keywords to
savepoint and the name of the savepoint, as in:
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
Here’s an example of how savepoints may be used:
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE product
SET date_retired = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';
SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;
UPDATE account
SET status = 'CLOSED', close_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
last_activity_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
WHERE product_cd = 'XYZ';
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT before_close_accounts;
COMMIT;
The net effect of this transaction is that the mythical XYZ
product is retired but none of the accounts are closed.
When using savepoints, remember the following:
Despite the name, nothing is saved when you create
a savepoint. You must eventually issue a commit if
you want your transaction to be made permanent.
If you issue a rollback without naming a savepoint,
all savepoints within the transaction will be ignored
and the entire transaction will be undone.
If you are using SQL Server, you will need to use the
proprietary command save transaction to create a
savepoint and rollback transaction to roll back to a
savepoint, with each command being followed by the
savepoint name.

Test Your Knowledge
Test your understanding of transactions by working
through the following exercise. When you’re done,
compare your solution with that in Appendix C.
Exercise 12-1
Generate a transaction to transfer $50 from Frank
Tucker’s money market account to his checking account.
You will need to insert two rows into the transaction
table and update two rows in the account table.

Chapter 13. Indexes and Constraints
Because the focus of this book is on programming
techniques, the first 12 chapters concentrated on
elements of the SQL language that you can use to craft
powerful select, insert, update, and delete
statements. However, other database features indirectly
affect the code you write. This chapter focuses on two of
those features: indexes and constraints.
Indexes
When you insert a row into a table, the database server
does not attempt to put the data in any particular
location within the table. For example, if you add a row
to the department table, the server doesn’t place the row
in numeric order via the dept_id column or in
alphabetical order via the name column. Instead, the
server simply places the data in the next available
location within the file (the server maintains a list of free
space for each table). When you query the department
table, therefore, the server will need to inspect every row
of the table to answer the query. For example, let’s say
that you issue the following query:
mysql> SELECT dept_id, name
-> FROM department
-> WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
+---------+----------------+
| dept_id | name |
+---------+----------------+
| 3 | Administration |
+---------+----------------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
To find all departments whose name begins with A, the
server must visit each row in the department table and
inspect the contents of the name column; if the
department name begins with A, then the row is added to
the result set. This type of access is known as a table
scan.
While this method works fine for a table with only three
rows, imagine how long it might take to answer the
query if the table contains 3 million rows. At some
number of rows larger than three and smaller than 3

million, a line is crossed where the server cannot answer
the query within a reasonable amount of time without
additional help. This help comes in the form of one or
more indexes on the department table.
Even if you have never heard of a database index, you
are certainly aware of what an index is (e.g., this book
has one). An index is simply a mechanism for finding a
specific item within a resource. Each technical
publication, for example, includes an index at the end
that allows you to locate a specific word or phrase within
the publication. The index lists these words and phrases
in alphabetical order, allowing the reader to move
quickly to a particular letter within the index, find the
desired entry, and then find the page or pages on which
the word or phrase may be found.
In the same way that a person uses an index to find
words within a publication, a database server uses
indexes to locate rows in a table. Indexes are special
tables that, unlike normal data tables, are kept in a
specific order. Instead of containing all of the data about
an entity, however, an index contains only the column (or
columns) used to locate rows in the data table, along
with information describing where the rows are
physically located. Therefore, the role of indexes is to
facilitate the retrieval of a subset of a table’s rows and
columns without the need to inspect every row in the
table.
Index Creation
Returning to the department table, you might decide to
add an index on the name column to speed up any queries
that specify a full or partial department name, as well as
any update or delete operations that specify a
department name. Here’s how you can add such an index
to a MySQL database:
mysql> ALTER TABLE department
-> ADD INDEX dept_name_idx (name);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.08 sec)
Records: 3 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0

This statement creates an index (a B-tree index to be
precise, but more on this shortly) on the
department.name column; furthermore, the index is
given the name dept_name_idx. With the index in place,
the query optimizer (which we discussed in Chapter 3)
can choose to use the index if it is deemed beneficial to
do so (with only three rows in the department table, for
example, the optimizer might very well choose to ignore
the index and read the entire table). If there is more than
one index on a table, the optimizer must decide which
index will be the most beneficial for a particular SQL
statement.
Note ✎
MySQL treats indexes as optional components of a
table, which is why you must use the alter table
command to add or remove an index. Other database
servers, including SQL Server and Oracle Database,
treat indexes as independent schema objects. For
both SQL Server and Oracle, therefore, you would
generate an index using the create index command,
as in:
CREATE INDEX dept_name_idx
ON department (name);
As of MySQL version 5.0, a create index command
is available, although it is mapped to the alter
table command.
All database servers allow you to look at the available
indexes. MySQL users can use the show command to see
all of the indexes on a specific table, as in:
mysql> SHOW INDEX FROM department \G
*************************** 1. row
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Table: department
Non_unique: 0
Key_name: PRIMARY
Seq_in_index: 1
Column_name: dept_id

Sub_part: NULL

Index_type: BTREE
Comment:
Index_Comment:
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
The output shows that there are two indexes on the
department table: one on the dept_id column called
PRIMARY, and the other on the name column called
dept_name_idx. Since I have created only one index so
far (dept_name_idx), you might be wondering where the
other came from; when the department table was
created, the create table statement included a
constraint naming the dept_id column as the primary
key for the table. Here’s the statement used to create the
table:
CREATE TABLE department
(dept_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT pk_department PRIMARY KEY (dept_id) );
When the table was created, the MySQL server
automatically generated an index on the primary key
column, which, in this case, is dept_id, and gave the
index the name PRIMARY. I cover constraints later in this
chapter.
If, after creating an index, you decide that the index is
not proving useful, you can remove it via the following:
mysql> ALTER TABLE department
-> DROP INDEX dept_name_idx;
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 3 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0

Note ✎
SQL Server and Oracle Database users must use the
drop index command to remove an index, as in:
DROP INDEX dept_name_idx; (Oracle)
DROP INDEX dept_name_idx ON department (SQL Server)
MySQL now also supports a drop index command.
Unique indexes
When designing a database, it is important to consider
which columns are allowed to contain duplicate data and
which are not. For example, it is allowable to have two
customers named John Smith in the individual table
since each row will have a different identifier (cust_id),
birth date, and tax number (customer.fed_id) to help
tell them apart. You would not, however, want to allow
two departments with the same name in the department
table. You can enforce a rule against duplicate
department names by creating a unique index on the
department.name column.
A unique index plays multiple roles in that, along with
providing all the benefits of a regular index, it also serves
as a mechanism for disallowing duplicate values in the
indexed column. Whenever a row is inserted or when the
indexed column is modified, the database server checks
the unique index to see whether the value already exists
in another row in the table. Here’s how you would create
a unique index on the department.name column:
mysql> ALTER TABLE department
-> ADD UNIQUE dept_name_idx (name);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.04 sec)
Records: 3 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
Note ✎
SQL Server and Oracle Database users need only add
the unique keyword when creating an index, as in:
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX dept_name_idx
ON department (name);
With the index in place, you will receive an error if you
try to add another department with the name

'Operations':
mysql> INSERT INTO department (dept_id, name)
-> VALUES (999, 'Operations');
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry 'Operations' for key
'dept_name_idx'
You should not build unique indexes on your primary key
column(s), since the server already checks uniqueness
for primary key values. You may, however, create more
than one unique index on the same table if you feel that
it is warranted.
Multicolumn indexes
Along with the single-column indexes demonstrated thus
far, you may build indexes that span multiple columns. If,
for example, you find yourself searching for employees
by first and last names, you can build an index on both
columns together, as in:
mysql> ALTER TABLE employee
-> ADD INDEX emp_names_idx (lname, fname);
Query OK, 18 rows affected (0.10 sec)
Records: 18 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
This index will be useful for queries that specify the first
and last names or just the last name, but you cannot use
it for queries that specify only the employee’s first name.
To understand why, consider how you would find a
person’s phone number; if you know the person’s first
and last names, you can use a phone book to find the
number quickly, since a phone book is organized by last
name and then by first name. If you know only the
person’s first name, you would need to scan every entry
in the phone book to find all the entries with the
specified first name.
When building multiple-column indexes, therefore, you
should think carefully about which column to list first,
which column to list second, and so on so that the index
is as useful as possible. Keep in mind, however, that
there is nothing stopping you from building multiple
indexes using the same set of columns but in a different
order if you feel that it is needed to ensure adequate
response time.
Types of Indexes

Indexing is a powerful tool, but since there are many
different types of data, a single indexing strategy doesn’t
always do the job. The following sections illustrate the
different types of indexing available from various servers.
B-tree indexes
All the indexes shown thus far are balanced-tree indexes,
which are more commonly known as B-tree indexes.
MySQL, Oracle Database, and SQL Server all default to
B-tree indexing, so you will get a B-tree index unless you
explicitly ask for another type. As you might expect, B-
tree indexes are organized as trees, with one or more
levels of branch nodes leading to a single level of leaf
nodes. Branch nodes are used for navigating the tree,
while leaf nodes hold the actual values and location
information. For example, a B-tree index built on the
employee.lname column might look something like
Figure 13-1.
Figure 13-1. B-tree example
If you were to issue a query to retrieve all employees
whose last name starts with G, the server would look at
the top branch node (called the root node) and follow the
link to the branch node that handles last names
beginning with A through M. This branch node would, in
turn, direct the server to a leaf node containing last
names beginning with G through I. The server then starts

reading the values in the leaf node until it encounters a
value that doesn’t begin with G (which, in this case, is
'Hawthorne').
As rows are inserted, updated, and deleted from the
employee table, the server will attempt to keep the tree
balanced so that there aren’t far more branch/leaf nodes
on one side of the root node than the other. The server
can add or remove branch nodes to redistribute the
values more evenly and can even add or remove an entire
level of branch nodes. By keeping the tree balanced, the
server is able to traverse quickly to the leaf nodes to find
the desired values without having to navigate through
many levels of branch nodes.
Bitmap indexes
Although B-tree indexes are great at handling columns
that contain many different values, such as a customer’s
first/last names, they can become unwieldy when built on
a column that allows only a small number of values. For
example, you may decide to generate an index on the
account.product_cd column so that you can quickly
retrieve all accounts of a specific type (e.g., checking,
savings). Because there are only eight different products,
however, and because some products are far more
popular than others, it can be difficult to maintain a
balanced B-tree index as the number of accounts grows.
For columns that contain only a small number of values
across a large number of rows (known as low-cardinality
data), a different indexing strategy is needed. To handle
this situation more efficiently, Oracle Database includes
bitmap indexes, which generate a bitmap for each value
stored in the column. Figure 13-2 shows what a bitmap
index might look like for data in the account.product_cd
column.

Figure 13-2. Bitmap example
The index contains six bitmaps, one for each value in the
product_cd column (two of the eight available products
are not being used), and each bitmap includes a 0/1 value
for each of the 24 rows in the account table. Thus, if you
ask the server to retrieve all money market accounts
(product_cd = 'MM'), the server simply finds all the 1
values in the MM bitmap and returns rows 7, 10, and 18.
The server can also combine bitmaps if you are looking
for multiple values; for example, if you want to retrieve
all money market and savings accounts (product_cd =
'MM' or product_cd = 'SAV'), the server can perform an
OR operation on the MM and SAV bitmaps and return rows
2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 16, and 18.
Bitmap indexes are a nice, compact indexing solution for
low-cardinality data, but this indexing strategy breaks
down if the number of values stored in the column climbs
too high in relation to the number of rows (known as
high-cardinality data), since the server would need to
maintain too many bitmaps. For example, you would
never build a bitmap index on your primary key column,
since this represents the highest possible cardinality (a
different value for every row).
Oracle users can generate bitmap indexes by simply
adding the bitmap keyword to the create index
statement, as in:
CREATE BITMAP INDEX acc_prod_idx ON account (product_cd);

Bitmap indexes are commonly used in data warehousing
environments, where large amounts of data are generally
indexed on columns containing relatively few values
(e.g., sales quarters, geographic regions, products,
salespeople).
Text indexes
If your database stores documents, you may need to
allow users to search for words or phrases in the
documents. You certainly don’t want the server to open
each document and scan for the desired text each time a
search is requested, but traditional indexing strategies
don’t work for this situation. To handle this situation,
MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle Database include
specialized indexing and search mechanisms for
documents; both SQL Server and MySQL include what
they call full-text indexes (for MySQL, full-text indexes
are available only with its MyISAM storage engine), and
Oracle Database includes a powerful set of tools known
as Oracle Text. Document searches are specialized
enough that I refrain from showing an example, but I
wanted you to at least know what is available.
How Indexes Are Used
Indexes are generally used by the server to quickly
locate rows in a particular table, after which the server
visits the associated table to extract the additional
information requested by the user. Consider the
following query:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname
-> FROM employee
-> WHERE emp_id IN (1, 3, 9, 15);
+--------+---------+----------+
| emp_id | fname | lname |
+--------+---------+----------+
| 1 | Michael | Smith |
| 3 | Robert | Tyler |
| 9 | Jane | Grossman |
| 15 | Frank | Portman |
+--------+---------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
For this query, the server can use the primary key index
on the emp_id column to locate employee IDs 1, 3, 9, and

15 in the employee table, and then visit each of the four
rows to retrieve the first and last name columns.
If the index contains everything needed to satisfy the
query, however, the server doesn’t need to visit the
associated table. To illustrate, let’s look at how the query
optimizer approaches the same query with different
indexes in place.
The query, which aggregates account balances for
specific customers, looks as follows:
mysql> SELECT cust_id, SUM(avail_balance) tot_bal
-> FROM account
-> WHERE cust_id IN (1, 5, 9, 11)
-> GROUP BY cust_id;
+---------+----------+
| cust_id | tot_bal |
+---------+----------+
| 1 | 4557.75 |
| 5 | 2237.97 |
| 9 | 10971.22 |
| 11 | 9345.55 |
+---------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
To see how MySQL’s query optimizer decides to execute
the query, I use the explain statement to ask the server
to show the execution plan for the query rather than
executing the query:
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT cust_id, SUM(avail_balance) tot_bal
-> FROM account
-> WHERE cust_id IN (1, 5, 9, 11)
-> GROUP BY cust_id \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
id: 1
select_type: SIMPLE
table: account
type: index
possible_keys: fk_a_cust_id
key: fk_a_cust_id
key_len: 4
ref: NULL
rows: 24
Extra: Using where
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Note ✎
Each database server includes tools to allow you to
see how the query optimizer handles your SQL
statement. SQL Server allows you to see an execution
plan by issuing the statement set showplan_text on
before running your SQL statement. Oracle Database
includes the explain plan statement, which writes
the execution plan to a special table called
plan_table.
Without going into too much detail, here’s what the
execution plan tells you:
The fk_a_cust_id index is used to find the rows in
the account table that satisfy the where clause.
After reading the index, the server expects to read all
24 rows of the account table to gather the available
balance data, since it doesn’t know that there might
be other customers besides IDs 1, 5, 9, and 11.
The fk_a_cust_id index is another index generated
automatically by the server, but this time it is because of
a foreign key constraint rather than a primary key
constraint (more on this later in the chapter). The
fk_a_cust_id index is built on the account.cust_id
column, so the server is using the index to locate
customer IDs 1, 5, 9, and 11 in the account table and is
then visiting those rows to retrieve and aggregate the
available balance data.
Next, I will add a new index called acc_bal_idx on both
the cust_id and avail_balance columns:
mysql> ALTER TABLE account
-> ADD INDEX acc_bal_idx (cust_id, avail_balance);
Query OK, 24 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 24 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
With this index in place, let’s see how the query
optimizer approaches the same query:
mysql> EXPLAIN SELECT cust_id, SUM(avail_balance) tot_bal
-> FROM account
-> WHERE cust_id IN (1, 5, 9, 11)
-> GROUP BY cust_id \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
id: 1
select_type: SIMPLE

table: account
type: range
possible_keys: acc_bal_idx
key: acc_bal_idx
key_len: 4
ref: NULL
rows: 8
Extra: Using where; Using index
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
Comparing the two execution plans yields the following
differences:
The optimizer is using the new acc_bal_idx index
instead of the fk_a_cust_id index.
The optimizer anticipates needing only eight rows
instead of 24.
The account table is not needed (designated by
Using index in the Extra column) to satisfy the
query results.
Therefore, the server can use indexes to help locate rows
in the associated table, or the server can use an index as
though it were a table as long as the index contains all
the columns needed by the query.
Note ✎
The process that I just led you through is an example
of query tuning. Tuning involves looking at an SQL
statement and determining the resources available to
the server to execute the statement. You can decide
to modify the SQL statement, to adjust the database
resources, or to do both in order to make a statement
run more efficiently. Tuning is a detailed topic, and I
strongly urge you to either read your server’s tuning
guide or pick up a good tuning book so that you can
see all the different approaches available for your
server.
The Downside of Indexes
If indexes are so great, why not index everything? Well,
the key to understanding why more indexes are not
necessarily a good thing is to keep in mind that every
index is a table (a special type of table, but still a table).
Therefore, every time a row is added to or removed from

a table, all indexes on that table must be modified. When
a row is updated, any indexes on the column or columns
that were affected need to be modified as well.
Therefore, the more indexes you have, the more work the
server needs to do to keep all schema objects up-to-date,
which tends to slow things down.
Indexes also require disk space as well as some amount
of care from your administrators, so the best strategy is
to add an index when a clear need arises. If you need an
index for only special purposes, such as a monthly
maintenance routine, you can always add the index, run
the routine, and then drop the index until you need it
again. In the case of data warehouses, where indexes are
crucial during business hours as users run reports and
ad hoc queries but are problematic when data is being
loaded into the warehouse overnight, it is a common
practice to drop the indexes before data is loaded and
then re-create them before the warehouse opens for
business.
In general, you should strive to have neither too many
indexes nor too few. If you aren’t sure how many indexes
you should have, you can use this strategy as a default:
Make sure all primary key columns are indexed (most
servers automatically create unique indexes when
you create primary key constraints). For multicolumn
primary keys, consider building additional indexes on
a subset of the primary key columns, or on all the
primary key columns but in a different order than the
primary key constraint definition.
Build indexes on all columns that are referenced in
foreign key constraints. Keep in mind that the server
checks to make sure there are no child rows when a
parent is deleted, so it must issue a query to search
for a particular value in the column. If there’s no
index on the column, the entire table must be
scanned.
Index any columns that will frequently be used to
retrieve data. Most date columns are good

candidates, along with short (3- to 50-character)
string columns.
After you have built your initial set of indexes, try to
capture actual queries against your tables, and modify
your indexing strategy to fit the most-common access
paths.

Constraints
A constraint is simply a restriction placed on one or more
columns of a table. There are several different types of
constraints, including:
Primary key constraints
Identify the column or columns that guarantee
uniqueness within a table
Foreign key constraints
Restrict one or more columns to contain only values
found in another table’s primary key columns, and
may also restrict the allowable values in other tables
if update cascade or delete cascade rules are
established
Unique constraints
Restrict one or more columns to contain unique values
within a table (primary key constraints are a special
type of unique constraint)
Check constraints
Restrict the allowable values for a column
Without constraints, a database’s consistency is suspect.
For example, if the server allows you to change a
customer’s ID in the customer table without changing
the same customer ID in the account table, then you will
end up with accounts that no longer point to valid
customer records (known as orphaned rows). With
primary and foreign key constraints in place, however,
the server will either raise an error if an attempt is made
to modify or delete data that is referenced by other
tables, or propagate the changes to other tables for you
(more on this shortly).
Note ✎
If you want to use foreign key constraints with the
MySQL server, you must use the InnoDB storage
engine for your tables. Foreign key constraints are
not supported in the Falcon engine as of version
6.0.4, but they will be supported in later versions.
Constraint Creation

Constraints are generally created at the same time as the
associated table via the create table statement. To
illustrate, here’s an example from the schema generation
script for this book’s example database:
CREATE TABLE product
(product_cd VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
product_type_cd VARCHAR (10) NOT NULL,
date_offered DATE,
date_retired DATE,
CONSTRAINT fk_product_type_cd FOREIGN KEY
(product_type_cd)
REFERENCES product_type (product_type_cd),
CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (product_cd)
);
The product table includes two constraints: one to
specify that the product_cd column serves as the
primary key for the table, and another to specify that the
product_type_cd column serves as a foreign key to the
product_type table. Alternatively, you can create the
product table without constraints, and add the primary
and foreign key constraints later via alter table
statements:
ALTER TABLE product
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (product_cd);
ALTER TABLE product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_type_cd FOREIGN KEY
(product_type_cd)
REFERENCES product_type (product_type_cd);
If you want to remove a primary or foreign key
constraint, you can use the alter table statement
again, except that you specify drop instead of add, as in:
ALTER TABLE product
DROP PRIMARY KEY;
ALTER TABLE product
DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_product_type_cd;
While it is unusual to drop a primary key constraint,
foreign key constraints are sometimes dropped during
certain maintenance operations and then reestablished.
Constraints and Indexes
As you saw earlier in the chapter, constraint creation
sometimes involves the automatic generation of an index.

However, database servers behave differently regarding
the relationship between constraints and indexes.
Table 13-1 shows how MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle
Database handle the relationship between constraints
and indexes.
Table 13-1. Constraint generation
Constraint type MySQL SQL Server Oracle Database
Primary key Generates Generates Uses existing index or
constraints unique index unique index creates new index
Foreign key Generates Does not Does not generate index
constraints index generate index
Unique Generates Generates Uses existing index or
constraints unique index unique index creates new index
MySQL, therefore, generates a new index to enforce
primary key, foreign key, and unique constraints, SQL
Server generates a new index for primary key and unique
constraints but not for foreign key constraints, and
Oracle Database takes the same approach as SQL Server
except that Oracle will use an existing index (if an
appropriate one exists) to enforce primary key and
unique constraints. Although neither SQL Server nor
Oracle Database generates an index for a foreign key
constraint, both servers’ documentation advises that
indexes be created for every foreign key.
Cascading Constraints
With foreign key constraints in place, if a user attempts
to insert a new row or change an existing row such that a
foreign key column doesn’t have a matching value in the
parent table, the server raises an error. To illustrate,
here’s a look at the data in the product and
product_type tables:
mysql> SELECT product_type_cd, name
-> FROM product_type;
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
| product_type_cd | name |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
| ACCOUNT | Customer Accounts |
| INSURANCE | Insurance Offerings |
| LOAN | Individual and Business Loans |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT product_type_cd, product_cd, name
-> FROM product
-> ORDER BY product_type_cd;
+-----------------+------------+-------------------------+
| product_type_cd | product_cd | name |
+-----------------+------------+-------------------------+
| ACCOUNT | CD | certificate of deposit |
| ACCOUNT | CHK | checking account |
| ACCOUNT | MM | money market account |
| ACCOUNT | SAV | savings account |
| LOAN | AUT | auto loan |
| LOAN | BUS | business line of credit |
| LOAN | MRT | home mortgage |
| LOAN | SBL | small business loan |
+-----------------+------------+-------------------------+
8 rows in set (0.01 sec)
There are three different values for the product_type_cd
column in the product_type table (ACCOUNT, INSURANCE,
and LOAN). Of the three values, two of them (ACCOUNT and
LOAN) are referenced in the product table’s
product_type_cd column.
The following statement attempts to change the
product_type_cd column in the product table to a value
that doesn’t exist in the product_type table:
mysql> UPDATE product
-> SET product_type_cd = 'XYZ'
-> WHERE product_type_cd = 'LOAN';
ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a
foreign key constraint
fails ('bank'.'product', CONSTRAINT 'fk_product_type_cd'
FOREIGN KEY
('product_type_cd') REFERENCES 'product_type'
('product_type_cd'))
Because of the foreign key constraint on the
product.product_type_cd column, the server does not
allow the update to succeed, since there is no row in the
product_type table with a value of XYZ in the
product_type_cd column. Thus, the foreign key
constraint doesn’t let you change a child row if there is
no corresponding value in the parent.
What would happen, however, if you tried to change the
parent row in the product_type table to XYZ? Here’s an
update statement that attempts to change the LOAN
product type to XYZ:

mysql> UPDATE product_type
-> SET product_type_cd = 'XYZ'
-> WHERE product_type_cd = 'LOAN';
ERROR 1451 (23000): Cannot delete or update a parent row: a
foreign key
constraint fails ('bank'.'product', CONSTRAINT
'fk_product_type_cd' FOREIGN KEY
('product_type_cd') REFERENCES 'product_type'
('product_type_cd'))
Once again, an error is raised; this time because there
are child rows in the product table whose
product_type_cd column contains the value LOAN. This is
the default behavior for foreign key constraints, but it is
not the only possible behavior; instead, you can instruct
the server to propagate the change to all child rows for
you, thus preserving the integrity of the data. Known as a
cascading update, this variation of the foreign key
constraint can be installed by removing the existing
foreign key and adding a new one that includes the on
update cascade clause:
mysql> ALTER TABLE product
-> DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_product_type_cd;
Query OK, 8 rows affected (0.02 sec)
Records: 8 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
mysql> ALTER TABLE product
-> ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_type_cd FOREIGN KEY
(product_type_cd)
-> REFERENCES product_type (product_type_cd)
-> ON UPDATE CASCADE;
Query OK, 8 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 8 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
With this modified constraint in place, let’s see what
happens when the previous update statement is
attempted again:
mysql> UPDATE product_type
-> SET product_type_cd = 'XYZ'
-> WHERE product_type_cd = 'LOAN';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
This time, the statement succeeds. To verify that the
change was propagated to the product table, here’s
another look at the data in both tables:
mysql> SELECT product_type_cd, name
-> FROM product_type;
+-----------------+-------------------------------+

| product_type_cd | name |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
| ACCOUNT | Customer Accounts |
| INSURANCE | Insurance Offerings |
| XYZ | Individual and Business Loans |
+-----------------+-------------------------------+
3 rows in set (0.02 sec)
mysql> SELECT product_type_cd, product_cd, name
-> FROM product
-> ORDER BY product_type_cd;
+-----------------+------------+-------------------------+
| product_type_cd | product_cd | name |
+-----------------+------------+-------------------------+
| ACCOUNT | CD | certificate of deposit |
| ACCOUNT | CHK | checking account |
| ACCOUNT | MM | money market account |
| ACCOUNT | SAV | savings account |
| XYZ | AUT | auto loan |
| XYZ | BUS | business line of credit |
| XYZ | MRT | home mortgage |
| XYZ | SBL | small business loan |
+-----------------+------------+-------------------------+
8 rows in set (0.01 sec)
As you can see, the change to the product_type table
has been propagated to the product table as well. Along
with cascading updates, you can specify cascading
deletes as well. A cascading delete removes rows from
the child table when a row is deleted from the parent
table. To specify cascading deletes, use the on delete
cascade clause, as in:
ALTER TABLE product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_type_cd FOREIGN KEY
(product_type_cd)
REFERENCES product_type (product_type_cd)
ON UPDATE CASCADE
ON DELETE CASCADE;
With this version of the constraint in place, the server
will now update child rows in the product table when a
row in the product_type table is updated, as well as
delete child rows in the product table when a row in the
product_type table is deleted.
Cascading constraints are one case in which constraints
do directly affect the code that you write. You need to
know which constraints in your database specify

cascading updates and/or deletes so that you know the
full effect of your update and delete statements.

Test Your Knowledge
Work through the following exercises to test your
knowledge of indexes and constraints. When you’re done,
compare your solutions with those in Appendix C.
Exercise 13-1
Modify the account table so that customers may not have
more than one account for each product.
Exercise 13-2
Generate a multicolumn index on the transaction table
that could be used by both of the following queries:
SELECT txn_date, account_id, txn_type_cd, amount
FROM transaction
WHERE txn_date > cast('2008-12-31 23:59:59' as datetime);
SELECT txn_date, account_id, txn_type_cd, amount
FROM transaction
WHERE txn_date > cast('2008-12-31 23:59:59' as datetime)
AND amount < 1000;

Chapter 14. Views
Well-designed applications generally expose a public
interface while keeping implementation details private,
thereby enabling future design changes without
impacting end users. When designing your database, you
can achieve a similar result by keeping your tables
private and allowing your users to access data only
through a set of views. This chapter strives to define
what views are, how they are created, and when and how
you might want to use them.
What Are Views?
A view is simply a mechanism for querying data. Unlike
tables, views do not involve data storage; you won’t need
to worry about views filling up your disk space. You
create a view by assigning a name to a select statement,
and then storing the query for others to use. Other users
can then use your view to access data just as though they
were querying tables directly (in fact, they may not even
know they are using a view).
As a simple example, let’s say that you want to partially
obscure the federal IDs (Social Security numbers and
corporate identifiers) in the customer table. The
customer service department, for example, may need
access to just the last portion of the federal ID in order to
verify the identity of a caller, but exposing the entire
number would violate the company’s privacy policy.
Therefore, instead of allowing direct access to the
customer table, you define a view called customer_vw
and mandate that all bank personnel use it to access
customer data. Here’s the view definition:
CREATE VIEW customer_vw
(cust_id,
fed_id,
cust_type_cd,
address,
city,
state,
zipcode
)
AS

SELECT cust_id,
concat('ends in ', substr(fed_id, 8, 4)) fed_id,
cust_type_cd,
address,
city,
state,
postal_code
FROM customer;
The first part of the statement lists the view’s column
names, which may be different from those of the
underlying table (e.g., the customer_vw view has a
column named zipcode which maps to the
customer.postal_code column). The second part of the
statement is a select statement, which must contain one
expression for each column in the view.
When the create view statement is executed, the
database server simply stores the view definition for
future use; the query is not executed, and no data is
retrieved or stored. Once the view has been created,
users can query it just like they would a table, as in:
mysql> SELECT cust_id, fed_id, cust_type_cd
-> FROM customer_vw;
+---------+--------------+--------------+
| cust_id | fed_id | cust_type_cd |
+---------+--------------+--------------+
| 1 | ends in 1111 | I |
| 2 | ends in 2222 | I |
| 3 | ends in 3333 | I |
| 4 | ends in 4444 | I |
| 5 | ends in 5555 | I |
| 6 | ends in 6666 | I |
| 7 | ends in 7777 | I |
| 8 | ends in 8888 | I |
| 9 | ends in 9999 | I |
| 10 | ends in 111 | B |
| 11 | ends in 222 | B |
| 12 | ends in 333 | B |
| 13 | ends in 444 | B |
+---------+--------------+--------------+
13 rows in set (0.02 sec)
The actual query that the server executes is neither the
one submitted by the user nor the query attached to the
view definition. Instead, the server merges the two
together to create another statement, which in this case
looks as follows:

SELECT cust_id,
concat('ends in ', substr(fed_id, 8, 4)) fed_id,
cust_type_cd
FROM customer;
Even though the customer_vw view definition includes
seven columns of the customer table, the query executed
by the server retrieves only three of the seven. As you’ll
see later in the chapter, this is an important distinction if
some of the columns in your view are attached to
functions or subqueries.
From the user’s standpoint, a view looks exactly like a
table. If you want to know what columns are available in
a view, you can use MySQL’s (or Oracle’s) describe
command to examine it:
mysql> describe customer_vw;
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
---+
| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default |
Extra |
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
---+
| cust_id | int(10) unsigned | NO | | 0 |
|
| fed_id | varchar(12) | YES | | NULL |
|
| cust_type_cd | enum('I','B') | NO | | NULL |
|
| address | varchar(30) | YES | | NULL |
|
| city | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| state | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL |
|
| postal_code | varchar(10) | YES | | NULL |
|
+--------------+------------------+------+-----+---------+----
---+
7 rows in set (1.40 sec)
You are free to use any clauses of the select statement
when querying through a view, including group by,
having, and order by. Here’s an example:
mysql> SELECT cust_type_cd, count(*)
-> FROM customer_vw
-> WHERE state = 'MA'
-> GROUP BY cust_type_cd
-> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+----------+

| cust_type_cd | count(*) |
+--------------+----------+
| I | 7 |
| B | 2 |
+--------------+----------+
2 rows in set (0.22 sec)
In addition, you can join views to other tables (or even to
other views) within a query, as in:
mysql> SELECT cst.cust_id, cst.fed_id, bus.name
-> FROM customer_vw cst INNER JOIN business bus
-> ON cst.cust_id = bus.cust_id;
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| cust_id | fed_id | name |
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
| 10 | ends in 111 | Chilton Engineering |
| 11 | ends in 222 | Northeast Cooling Inc. |
| 12 | ends in 333 | Superior Auto Body |
| 13 | ends in 444 | AAA Insurance Inc. |
+---------+-------------+------------------------+
4 rows in set (0.24 sec)
This query joins the customer_vw view to the business
table in order to retrieve only business customers.

Why Use Views?
In the previous section, I demonstrated a simple view
whose sole purpose was to mask the contents of the
customer.fed_id column. While views are often
employed for this purpose, there are many reasons for
using views, as I demonstrate in the following
subsections.
Data Security
If you create a table and allow users to query it, they will
be able to access every column and every row in the
table. As I pointed out earlier, however, your table may
include some columns that contain sensitive data, such
as identification numbers or credit card numbers; not
only is it a bad idea to expose such data to all users, but
also it might violate your company’s privacy policies, or
even state or federal laws, to do so.
The best approach for these situations is to keep the
table private (i.e., don’t grant select permission to any
users) and then to create one or more views that either
omit or obscure (such as the 'ends in ####' approach
taken with the customer_vw.fed_id column) the
sensitive columns. You may also constrain which rows a
set of users may access by adding a where clause to your
view definition. For example, the next view definition
allows only business customers to be queried:
CREATE VIEW business_customer_vw
(cust_id,
fed_id,
cust_type_cd,
address,
city,
state,
zipcode
)
AS
SELECT cust_id,
concat('ends in ', substr(fed_id, 8, 4)) fed_id,
cust_type_cd,
address,
city,
state,
postal_code

FROM customer
WHERE cust_type_cd = 'B'
If you provide this view to your corporate banking
department, they will be able to access only business
accounts because the condition in the view’s where
clause will always be included in their queries.
Note ✎
Oracle Database users have another option for
securing both rows and columns of a table: Virtual
Private Database (VPD). VPD allows you to attach
policies to your tables, after which the server will
modify a user’s query as necessary to enforce the
policies. For example, if you enact a policy that
members of the corporate banking department can
see only business accounts, then the condition
cust_type_cd = 'B' will be added to all of their
queries against the customer table.
Data Aggregation
Reporting applications generally require aggregated
data, and views are a great way to make it appear as
though data is being pre-aggregated and stored in the
database. As an example, let’s say that an application
generates a report each month showing the number of
accounts and total deposits for every customer. Rather
than allowing the application developers to write queries
against the base tables, you could provide them with the
following view:
CREATE VIEW customer_totals_vw
(cust_id,
cust_type_cd,
cust_name,
num_accounts,
tot_deposits
)
AS
SELECT cst.cust_id, cst.cust_type_cd,
CASE
WHEN cst.cust_type_cd = 'B' THEN
(SELECT bus.name FROM business bus WHERE bus.cust_id =
cst.cust_id)
ELSE
(SELECT concat(ind.fname, ' ', ind.lname)

FROM individual ind
WHERE ind.cust_id = cst.cust_id)
END cust_name,
sum(CASE WHEN act.status = 'ACTIVE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
tot_active_accounts,
sum(CASE WHEN act.status = 'ACTIVE' THEN act.avail_balance
ELSE 0 END) tot_balance
FROM customer cst INNER JOIN account act
ON act.cust_id = cst.cust_id
GROUP BY cst.cust_id, cst.cust_type_cd;
Using this approach gives you a great deal of flexibility
as a database designer. If you decide at some point in the
future that query performance would improve
dramatically if the data were preaggregated in a table
rather than summed using a view, you can create a
customer_totals table and modify the
customer_totals_vw view definition to retrieve data
from this table. Before modifying the view definition, you
can use it to populate the new table. Here are the
necessary SQL statements for this scenario:
mysql> CREATE TABLE customer_totals
-> AS
-> SELECT * FROM customer_totals_vw;
Query OK, 13 rows affected (3.33 sec)
Records: 13 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
mysql> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_totals_vw
-> (cust_id,
-> cust_type_cd,
-> cust_name,
-> num_accounts,
-> tot_deposits
-> )
-> AS
-> SELECT cust_id, cust_type_cd, cust_name,
num_accounts, tot_deposits
-> FROM customer_totals;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
From now on, all queries that use the
customer_totals_vw view will pull data from the new
customer_totals table, meaning that users will see a
performance improvement without needing to modify
their queries.
Hiding Complexity

One of the most common reasons for deploying views is
to shield end users from complexity. For example, let’s
say that a report is created each month showing the
number of employees, the total number of active
accounts, and the total number of transactions for each
branch. Rather than expecting the report designer to
navigate four different tables to gather the necessary
data, you could provide a view that looks as follows:
CREATE VIEW branch_activity_vw
(branch_name,
city,
state,
num_employees,
num_active_accounts,
tot_transactions
)
AS
SELECT br.name, br.city, br.state,
(SELECT count(*)
FROM employee emp
WHERE emp.assigned_branch_id = br.branch_id) num_emps,
(SELECT count(*)
FROM account acnt
WHERE acnt.status = 'ACTIVE' AND acnt.open_branch_id =
br.branch_id) num_accounts,
(SELECT count(*)
FROM transaction txn
WHERE txn.execution_branch_id = br.branch_id) num_txns
FROM branch br;
This view definition is interesting because three of the
six column values are generated using scalar subqueries.
If someone uses this view but does not reference the
num_employees, num_active_accounts, or
tot_transactions column, then none of the subqueries
will be executed.
Joining Partitioned Data
Some database designs break large tables into multiple
pieces in order to improve performance. For example, if
the transaction table became large, the designers may
decide to break it into two tables: transaction_current,
which holds the latest six months’ of data, and
transaction_historic, which holds all data up to six
months ago. If a customer wants to see all the

transactions for a particular account, you would need to
query both tables. By creating a view that queries both
tables and combines the results together, however, you
can make it look like all transaction data is stored in a
single table. Here’s the view definition:
CREATE VIEW transaction_vw
(txn_date,
account_id,
txn_type_cd,
amount,
teller_emp_id,
execution_branch_id,
funds_avail_date
)
AS
SELECT txn_date, account_id, txn_type_cd, amount,
teller_emp_id,
execution_branch_id, funds_avail_date
FROM transaction_historic
UNION ALL
SELECT txn_date, account_id, txn_type_cd, amount,
teller_emp_id,
execution_branch_id, funds_avail_date
FROM transaction_current;
Using a view in this case is a good idea because it allows
the designers to change the structure of the underlying
data without the need to force all database users to
modify their queries.

Updatable Views
If you provide users with a set of views to use for data
retrieval, what should you do if the users also need to
modify the same data? It might seem a bit strange, for
example, to force the users to retrieve data using a view,
but then allow them to directly modify the underlying
table using update or insert statements. For this
purpose, MySQL, Oracle Database, and SQL Server all
allow you to modify data through a view, as long as you
abide by certain restrictions. In the case of MySQL, a
view is updatable if the following conditions are met:
No aggregate functions are used (max(), min(),
avg(), etc.).
The view does not employ group by or having
clauses.
No subqueries exist in the select or from clause,
and any subqueries in the where clause do not refer
to tables in the from clause.
The view does not utilize union, union all, or
distinct.
The from clause includes at least one table or
updatable view.
The from clause uses only inner joins if there is more
than one table or view.
To demonstrate the utility of updatable views, it might be
best to start with a simple view definition and then to
move to a more complex view.
Updating Simple Views
The view at the beginning of the chapter is about as
simple as it gets, so let’s start there:
CREATE VIEW customer_vw
(cust_id,
fed_id,
cust_type_cd,
address,
city,
state,
zipcode
)
AS

SELECT cust_id,
concat('ends in ', substr(fed_id, 8, 4)) fed_id,
cust_type_cd,
address,
city,
state,
postal_code
FROM customer;
The customer_vw view queries a single table, and only
one of the seven columns is derived via an expression.
This view definition doesn’t violate any of the restrictions
listed earlier, so you can use it to modify data in the
customer table, as in:
mysql> UPDATE customer_vw
-> SET city = 'Woooburn'
-> WHERE city = 'Woburn';
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.34 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
As you can see, the statement claims to have modified
one row, but let’s check the underlying customer table
just to be sure:
mysql> SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customer;
+------------+
| city |
+------------+
| Lynnfield |
| Woooburn |
| Quincy |
| Waltham |
| Salem |
| Wilmington |
| Newton |
+------------+
7 rows in set (0.12 sec)
While you can modify most of the columns in the view in
this fashion, you will not be able to modify the fed_id
column, since it is derived from an expression:
mysql> UPDATE customer_vw
-> SET city = 'Woburn', fed_id = '999999999'
-> WHERE city = 'Woooburn';
ERROR 1348 (HY000): Column 'fed_id' is not updatable
In this case, it may not be a bad thing, since the whole
point of the view is to obscure the federal identifiers.
If you want to insert data using the customer_vw view,
you are out of luck; views that contain derived columns
cannot be used for inserting data, even if the derived

columns are not included in the statement. For example,
the next statement attempts to populate only the
cust_id, cust_type_cd, and city columns using the
customer_vw view:
mysql> INSERT INTO customer_vw(cust_id, cust_type_cd, city)
-> VALUES (9999, 'I', 'Worcester');
ERROR 1471 (HY000): The target table customer_vw of the INSERT
is not insertable
-into
Now that you have seen the limitations of simple views,
the next section will demonstrate the use of a view that
joins multiple tables.
Updating Complex Views
While single-table views are certainly common, many of
the views that you come across will include multiple
tables in the from clause of the underlying query. The
next view, for example, joins the business and customer
tables so that all the data for business customers can be
easily queried:
CREATE VIEW business_customer_vw
(cust_id,
fed_id,
address,
city,
state,
postal_code,
business_name,
state_id,
incorp_date
)
AS
SELECT cst.cust_id,
cst.fed_id,
cst.address,
cst.city,
cst.state,
cst.postal_code,
bsn.name,
bsn.state_id,
bsn.incorp_date
FROM customer cst INNER JOIN business bsn
ON cst.cust_id = bsn.cust_id
WHERE cust_type_cd = 'B';
You may use this view to update data in either the
customer or the business table, as the following

statements demonstrate:
mysql> UPDATE business_customer_vw
-> SET postal_code = '99999'
-> WHERE cust_id = 10;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.09 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
mysql> UPDATE business_customer_vw
-> SET incorp_date = '2008-11-17'
-> WHERE cust_id = 10;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.11 sec)
Rows matched: 1 Changed: 1 Warnings: 0
The first statement modifies the customer.postal_code
column, whereas the second statement modifies the
business.incorp_date column. You might be wondering
what happens if you try to update columns from both
tables in a single statement, so let’s find out:
mysql> UPDATE business_customer_vw
-> SET postal_code = '88888', incorp_date = '2008-10-31'
-> WHERE cust_id = 10;
ERROR 1393 (HY000): Can not modify more than one base table
through a join view
'bank.business_customer_vw'
As you can see, you are allowed to modify both of the
underlying tables, as long as you don’t try to do it with a
single statement. Now let’s try to insert data into both
tables for a new customer (cust_id = 99):
mysql> INSERT INTO business_customer_vw
-> (cust_id, fed_id, address, city, state, postal_code)

ERROR 1393 (HY000): Can not modify more than one base table
through a join view
'bank.business_customer_vw'
The first statement, which attempts to insert data into
the customer table, works fine, but the second
statement, which attempts to insert a row into the
business table, raises an exception. The second
statement fails because both tables include a cust_id
column, but the cust_id column in the view definition is

mapped to the customer.cust_id column. Therefore, it
is not possible to insert data into the business table
using the preceding view definition.
Note ✎
Oracle Database and SQL Server also allow data to
be inserted and updated through views, but, like
MySQL, there are many restrictions. If you are
willing to write some PL/SQL or Transact-SQL,
however, you can use a feature called instead-of
triggers, which allows you to essentially intercept
insert, update, and delete statements against a
view, and write custom code to incorporate the
changes. Without this type of feature, there are
simply too many restrictions to make updating
through views a feasible strategy for nontrivial
applications.

Test Your Knowledge
Test your understanding of views by working through the
following exercises. When you’re done, compare your
solutions with those in Appendix C.
Exercise 14-1
Create a view that queries the employee table and
generates the following output when queried with no
where clause:
+-----------------+------------------+
| supervisor_name | employee_name |
+-----------------+------------------+
| NULL | Michael Smith |
| Michael Smith | Susan Barker |
| Michael Smith | Robert Tyler |

Exercise 14-2
The bank president would like to have a report showing
the name and city of each branch, along with the total
balances of all accounts opened at the branch. Create a
view to generate the data.

Chapter 15. Metadata
Along with storing all of the data that various users
insert into a database, a database server also needs to
store information about all of the database objects
(tables, views, indexes, etc.) that were created to store
this data. The database server stores this information,
not surprisingly, in a database. This chapter discusses
how and where this information, known as metadata, is
stored, how you can access it, and how you can use it to
build flexible systems.
Data About Data
Metadata is essentially data about data. Every time you
create a database object, the database server needs to
record various pieces of information. For example, if you
were to create a table with multiple columns, a primary
key constraint, three indexes, and a foreign key
constraint, the database server would need to store all
the following information:
Table name
Table storage information (tablespace, initial size,
etc.)
Storage engine
Column names
Column data types
Default column values
NOT NULL column constraints
Primary key columns
Primary key name
Name of primary key index
Index names
Index types (B-tree, bitmap)
Indexed columns
Index column sort order (ascending or descending)
Index storage information
Foreign key name
Foreign key columns
Associated table/columns for foreign keys

This data is collectively known as the data dictionary or
system catalog. The database server needs to store this
data persistently, and it needs to be able to quickly
retrieve this data in order to verify and execute SQL
statements. Additionally, the database server must
safeguard this data so that it can be modified only via an
appropriate mechanism, such as the alter table
statement.
While standards exist for the exchange of metadata
between different servers, every database server uses a
different mechanism to publish metadata, such as:
A set of views, such as Oracle Database’s
user_tables and all_constraints views
A set of system-stored procedures, such as SQL
Server’s sp_tables procedure or Oracle Database’s
dbms_metadata package
A special database, such as MySQL’s
information_schema database
Along with SQL Server’s system-stored procedures,
which are a vestige of its Sybase lineage, SQL Server
also includes a special schema called
information_schema that is provided automatically
within each database. Both MySQL and SQL Server
provide this interface to conform with the ANSI
SQL:2003 standard. The remainder of this chapter
discusses the information_schema objects that are
available in MySQL and SQL Server.

Information_Schema
All of the objects available within the
information_schema database (or schema, in the case of
SQL Server) are views. Unlike the describe utility, which
I used in several chapters of this book as a way to show
the structure of various tables and views, the views
within information_schema can be queried, and, thus,
used programmatically (more on this later in the
chapter). Here’s an example that demonstrates how to
retrieve the names of all of the tables in the bank
database:
mysql> SELECT table_name, table_type
-> FROM information_schema.tables
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank'
-> ORDER BY 1;
+----------------------+------------+
| table_name | table_type |
+----------------------+------------+
| account | BASE TABLE |
| branch | BASE TABLE |
| branch_activity_vw | VIEW |
| business | BASE TABLE |
| business_customer_vw | VIEW |
| customer | BASE TABLE |
| customer_vw | VIEW |
| department | BASE TABLE |
| employee | BASE TABLE |
| employee_vw | VIEW |
| individual | BASE TABLE |
| nh_customer_vw | VIEW |
| officer | BASE TABLE |
| product | BASE TABLE |
| product_type | BASE TABLE |
| transaction | BASE TABLE |
+----------------------+------------+
16 rows in set (0.02 sec)
Along with the various tables we created back in
Chapter 2, the results show several of the views that I
demonstrated in Chapter 14. If you want to exclude the
views, simply add another condition to the where clause:
mysql> SELECT table_name, table_type
-> FROM information_schema.tables
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_type = 'BASE
TABLE'
-> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+------------+

| table_name | table_type |
+--------------+------------+
| account | BASE TABLE |
| branch | BASE TABLE |
| business | BASE TABLE |
| customer | BASE TABLE |
| department | BASE TABLE |
| employee | BASE TABLE |
| individual | BASE TABLE |
| officer | BASE TABLE |
| product | BASE TABLE |
| product_type | BASE TABLE |
| transaction | BASE TABLE |
+--------------+------------+
11 rows in set (0.01 sec)
If you are only interested in information about views, you
can query information_schema.views. Along with the
view names, you can retrieve additional information,
such as a flag that shows whether a view is updatable:
mysql> SELECT table_name, is_updatable
-> FROM information_schema.views
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank'
-> ORDER BY 1;
+----------------------+--------------+
| table_name | is_updatable |
+----------------------+--------------+
| branch_activity_vw | NO |
| business_customer_vw | YES |
| customer_vw | YES |
| employee_vw | YES |
| nh_customer_vw | YES |
+----------------------+--------------+
5 rows in set (1.83 sec)
Additionally, you can retrieve the view’s underlying query
using the view_definition column, as long as the query
is small enough (4,000 characters or fewer for MySQL).
Column information for both tables and views is available
via the columns view. The following query shows column
information for the account table:
mysql> SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length
char_max_len,
-> numeric_precision num_prcsn, numeric_scale num_scale
-> FROM information_schema.columns
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name = 'account'
-> ORDER BY ordinal_position;
+--------------------+-----------+--------------+-----------+-
----------+
| column_name | data_type | char_max_len | num_prcsn |

num_scale |
+--------------------+-----------+--------------+-----------+-
----------+
| account_id | int | NULL | 10 |
0 |
| product_cd | varchar | 10 | NULL |
NULL |
| cust_id | int | NULL | 10 |
0 |
| open_date | date | NULL | NULL |
NULL |
| close_date | date | NULL | NULL |
NULL |
| last_activity_date | date | NULL | NULL |
NULL |
| status | enum | 6 | NULL |
NULL |
| open_branch_id | smallint | NULL | 5 |
0 |
| open_emp_id | smallint | NULL | 5 |
0 |
| avail_balance | float | NULL | 10 |
2 |
| pending_balance | float | NULL | 10 |
2 |
+--------------------+-----------+--------------+-----------+-
----------+
11 rows in set (0.02 sec)
The ordinal_position column is included merely as a
means to retrieve the columns in the order in which they
were added to the table.
You can retrieve information about a table’s indexes via
the information_schema.statistics view as
demonstrated by the following query, which retrieves
information for the indexes built on the account table:
mysql> SELECT index_name, non_unique, seq_in_index,
column_name
-> FROM information_schema.statistics
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name = 'account'
-> ORDER BY 1, 3;
+----------------+------------+--------------+----------------
+
| index_name | non_unique | seq_in_index | column_name
|
+----------------+------------+--------------+----------------
+
| acc_bal_idx | 1 | 1 | cust_id
|
| acc_bal_idx | 1 | 2 | avail_balance

|
| fk_a_branch_id | 1 | 1 | open_branch_id
|
| fk_a_emp_id | 1 | 1 | open_emp_id
|
| fk_product_cd | 1 | 1 | product_cd
|
| PRIMARY | 0 | 1 | account_id
|
+----------------+------------+--------------+----------------
+
6 rows in set (0.09 sec)
The account table has a total of five indexes, one of
which has two columns (acc_bal_idx) and one of which
is a unique index (PRIMARY).
You can retrieve the different types of constraints
(foreign key, primary key, unique) that have been created
via the information_schema.table_constraints view.
Here’s a query that retrieves all of the constraints in the
bank schema:
mysql> SELECT constraint_name, table_name, constraint_type
-> FROM information_schema.table_constraints
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank'
-> ORDER BY 3,1;
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------+
| constraint_name | table_name | constraint_type |
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------+
| fk_a_branch_id | account | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_a_cust_id | account | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_a_emp_id | account | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_b_cust_id | business | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_dept_id | employee | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_exec_branch_id | transaction | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_e_branch_id | employee | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_e_emp_id | employee | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_i_cust_id | individual | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_o_cust_id | officer | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_product_cd | account | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_product_type_cd | product | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_teller_emp_id | transaction | FOREIGN KEY |
| fk_t_account_id | transaction | FOREIGN KEY |
| PRIMARY | branch | PRIMARY KEY |
| PRIMARY | account | PRIMARY KEY |

| PRIMARY | employee | PRIMARY KEY |

| dept_name_idx | department | UNIQUE |
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------+

and dba_ views.

Working with Metadata
As I mentioned earlier, having the ability to retrieve
information about your schema objects via SQL queries
opens up some interesting possibilities. This section
shows several ways in which you can make use of
metadata in your applications.
Schema Generation Scripts
While some project teams include a full-time database
designer who oversees the design and implementation of
the database, many projects take the “design-by-
committee” approach, allowing multiple people to create
database objects. After several weeks or months of
development, you may need to generate a script that will
create the various tables, indexes, views, and so on that
the team has deployed. Although a variety of tools and
utilities will generate these types of scripts for you, you
can also query the information_schema views and
generate the script yourself.
As an example, let’s build a script that will create the
bank.customer table. Here’s the command used to build
the table, which I extracted from the script used to build
the example database:
create table customer
(cust_id integer unsigned not null auto_increment,
fed_id varchar(12) not null,
cust_type_cd enum('I','B') not null,
address varchar(30),
city varchar(20),
state varchar(20),
postal_code varchar(10),
constraint pk_customer primary key (cust_id)
);
Although it would certainly be easier to generate the
script with the use of a procedural language (e.g.,
Transact-SQL or Java), since this is a book about SQL I’m
going to write a single query that will generate the
create table statement. The first step is to query the
information_schema.columns table to retrieve
information about the columns in the table:
mysql> SELECT 'CREATE TABLE customer (' create_table_statement
-> UNION ALL

-> SELECT cols.txt
-> FROM
-> (SELECT concat(' ',column_name, ' ', column_type,
-> CASE
-> WHEN is_nullable = 'NO' THEN ' not null'
-> ELSE ''
-> END,
-> CASE
-> WHEN extra IS NOT NULL THEN concat(' ', extra)
-> ELSE ''
-> END,
-> ',') txt
-> FROM information_schema.columns
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name =
'customer'
-> ORDER BY ordinal_position
-> ) cols
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT ')';
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| create_table_statement |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| CREATE TABLE customer ( |
| cust_id int(10) unsigned not null auto_increment, |
| fed_id varchar(12) not null , |
| cust_type_cd enum('I','B') not null , |
| address varchar(30) , |
| city varchar(20) , |
| state varchar(20) , |
| postal_code varchar(10) , |
| ) |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
9 rows in set (0.04 sec)
Well, that got us pretty close; we just need to add queries
against the table_constraints and key_column_usage
views to retrieve information about the primary key
constraint:
mysql> SELECT 'CREATE TABLE customer (' create_table_statement
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT cols.txt
-> FROM
-> (SELECT concat(' ',column_name, ' ', column_type,
-> CASE
-> WHEN is_nullable = 'NO' THEN ' not null'
-> ELSE ''
-> END,
-> CASE
-> WHEN extra IS NOT NULL THEN concat(' ', extra)
-> ELSE ''
-> END,

-> ',') txt
-> FROM information_schema.columns
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name =
'customer'
-> ORDER BY ordinal_position
-> ) cols
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT concat(' constraint primary key (')
-> FROM information_schema.table_constraints
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name = 'customer'
-> AND constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY'
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT cols.txt
-> FROM
-> (SELECT concat(CASE WHEN ordinal_position > 1 THEN '
,'
-> ELSE ' ' END, column_name) txt
-> FROM information_schema.key_column_usage
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name =
'customer'
-> AND constraint_name = 'PRIMARY'
-> ORDER BY ordinal_position
-> ) cols
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT ' )'
-> UNION ALL
-> SELECT ')';
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| create_table_statement |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| CREATE TABLE customer ( |
| cust_id int(10) unsigned not null auto_increment, |
| fed_id varchar(12) not null , |
| cust_type_cd enum('I','B') not null , |
| address varchar(30) , |
| city varchar(20) , |
| state varchar(20) , |
| postal_code varchar(10) , |
| constraint primary key ( |
| cust_id |
| ) |
| ) |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
12 rows in set (0.02 sec)
To see whether the statement is properly formed, I’ll
paste the query output into the mysql tool (I’ve changed
the table name to customer2 so that it won’t step on our
other table):
mysql> CREATE TABLE customer2 (
-> cust_id int(10) unsigned not null auto_increment,

-> fed_id varchar(12) not null ,
-> cust_type_cd enum('I','B') not null ,
-> address varchar(30) ,
-> city varchar(20) ,
-> state varchar(20) ,
-> postal_code varchar(10) ,
-> constraint primary key (
-> cust_id
-> )
-> );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.14 sec)
The statement executed without errors, and there is now
a customer2 table in the bank database. In order for the
query to generate a well-formed create table statement
for any table, more work is required (such as handling
indexes and foreign key constraints), but I’ll leave that as
an exercise.
Deployment Verification
Many organizations allow for database maintenance
windows, wherein existing database objects may be
administered (such as adding/dropping partitions) and
new schema objects and code can be deployed. After the
deployment scripts have been run, it’s a good idea to run
a verification script to ensure that the new schema
objects are in place with the appropriate columns,
indexes, primary keys, and so forth. Here’s a query that
returns the number of columns, number of indexes, and
number of primary key constraints (0 or 1) for each table
in the bank schema:
mysql> SELECT tbl.table_name,
-> (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns clm
-> WHERE clm.table_schema = tbl.table_schema
-> AND clm.table_name = tbl.table_name) num_columns,
-> (SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.statistics
sta
-> WHERE sta.table_schema = tbl.table_schema
-> AND sta.table_name = tbl.table_name) num_indexes,
-> (SELECT count(*) FROM
information_schema.table_constraints tc
-> WHERE tc.table_schema = tbl.table_schema
-> AND tc.table_name = tbl.table_name
-> AND tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY')
num_primary_keys
-> FROM information_schema.tables tbl
-> WHERE tbl.table_schema = 'bank' AND tbl.table_type =

'BASE TABLE'
-> ORDER BY 1;
+--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------
+
| table_name | num_columns | num_indexes | num_primary_keys
|
+--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------
+
| account | 11 | 6 | 1
|
| branch | 6 | 1 | 1
|
| business | 4 | 1 | 1
|
| customer | 7 | 1 | 1
|
| department | 2 | 2 | 1
|
| employee | 9 | 4 | 1
|
| individual | 4 | 1 | 1
|
| officer | 7 | 2 | 1
|
| product | 5 | 2 | 1
|
| product_type | 2 | 1 | 1
|
| transaction | 8 | 4 | 1
|
+--------------+-------------+-------------+------------------
+
11 rows in set (13.83 sec)
You could execute this statement before and after the
deployment and then verify any differences between the
two sets of results before declaring the deployment a
success.
Dynamic SQL Generation
Some languages, such as Oracle’s PL/SQL and
Microsoft’s Transact-SQL, are supersets of the SQL
language, meaning that they include SQL statements in
their grammar along with the usual procedural
constructs, such as “if-then-else” and “while.” Other
languages, such as Java, include the ability to interface
with a relational database, but do not include SQL

statements in the grammar, meaning that all SQL
statements must be contained within strings.
Therefore, most relational database servers, including
SQL Server, Oracle Database, and MySQL, allow SQL
statements to be submitted to the server as strings.
Submitting strings to a database engine rather than
utilizing its SQL interface is generally known as dynamic
SQL execution. Oracle’s PL/SQL language, for example,
includes an execute immediate command, which you
can use to submit a string for execution, while SQL
Server includes a system stored procedure called
sp_executesql for executing SQL statements
dynamically.
MySQL provides the statements prepare, execute, and
deallocate to allow for dynamic SQL execution. Here’s a
simple example:
mysql> SET @qry = 'SELECT cust_id, cust_type_cd, fed_id FROM
customer';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)
mysql> PREPARE dynsql1 FROM @qry;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
Statement prepared
mysql> EXECUTE dynsql1;
+---------+--------------+-------------+
| cust_id | cust_type_cd | fed_id |
+---------+--------------+-------------+
| 1 | I | 111-11-1111 |
| 2 | I | 222-22-2222 |
| 3 | I | 333-33-3333 |
| 4 | I | 444-44-4444 |
| 5 | I | 555-55-5555 |
| 6 | I | 666-66-6666 |
| 7 | I | 777-77-7777 |
| 8 | I | 888-88-8888 |
| 9 | I | 999-99-9999 |
| 10 | B | 04-1111111 |
| 11 | B | 04-2222222 |
| 12 | B | 04-3333333 |
| 13 | B | 04-4444444 |
| 99 | I | 04-9999999 |
+---------+--------------+-------------+
14 rows in set (0.27 sec)

mysql> DEALLOCATE PREPARE dynsql1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
The set statement simply assigns a string to the qry
variable, which is then submitted to the database engine
(for parsing, security checking, and optimization) using
the prepare statement. After executing the statement by
calling execute, the statement must be closed using
deallocate prepare, which frees any database
resources (e.g., cursors) that have been utilized during
execution.
The next example shows how you could execute a query
that includes placeholders so that conditions can be
specified at runtime:
mysql> SET @qry = 'SELECT product_cd, name, product_type_cd,
date_offered, date_
retired FROM product WHERE product_cd = ?';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> PREPARE dynsql2 FROM @qry;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Statement prepared
mysql> SET @prodcd = 'CHK';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> EXECUTE dynsql2 USING @prodcd;
+------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------
---+-------------+
| product_cd | name | product_type_cd |
date_offered | date_retired|
+------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------
---+-------------+
| CHK | checking account | ACCOUNT | 2004-01-01
| NULL |
+------------+------------------+-----------------+-----------
---+-------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
mysql> SET @prodcd = 'SAV';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql> EXECUTE dynsql2 USING @prodcd;
+------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------
--+--------------+
| product_cd | name | product_type_cd |
date_offered | date_retired |
+------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------
--+--------------+

| SAV | savings account | ACCOUNT | 2004-01-01
| NULL |
+------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------
--+--------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
mysql> DEALLOCATE PREPARE dynsql2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
In this sequence, the query contains a placeholder (the ?
at the end of the statement) so that the product code can
be submitted at runtime. The statement is prepared once
and then executed twice, once for product code 'CHK'
and again for product code 'SAV', after which the
statement is closed.
What, you may wonder, does this have to do with
metadata? Well, if you are going to use dynamic SQL to
query a table, why not build the query string using
metadata rather than hardcoding the table definition?
The following example generates the same dynamic SQL
string as the previous example, but it retrieves the
column names from the information_schema.columns
view:
mysql> SELECT concat('SELECT ',
-> concat_ws(',', cols.col1, cols.col2, cols.col3,
cols.col4,
-> cols.col5, cols.col6, cols.col7, cols.col8,
cols.col9),
-> ' FROM product WHERE product_cd = ?')
-> INTO @qry
-> FROM
-> (SELECT
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 1 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col1,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 2 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col2,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 3 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col3,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 4 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col4,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 5 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col5,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 6 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col6,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 7 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col7,
-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 8 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col8,

-> max(CASE WHEN ordinal_position = 9 THEN column_name
-> ELSE NULL END) col9
-> FROM information_schema.columns
-> WHERE table_schema = 'bank' AND table_name =
'product'
-> GROUP BY table_name
-> ) cols;

The query pivots the first nine columns in the product
table, builds a query string using the concat and

concat_ws functions, and assigns the string to the qry
variable. The query string is then executed as before.
Note ✎
Generally, it would be better to generate the query
using a procedural language that includes looping
constructs, such as Java, PL/SQL, Transact-SQL, or
MySQL’s Stored Procedure Language. However, I
wanted to demonstrate a pure SQL example, so I had
to limit the number of columns retrieved to some
reasonable number, which in this example is nine.

Test Your Knowledge
The following exercises are designed to test your

"ALTER TABLE <table_name> ADD INDEX <index_name>
(<column_list>)"

Appendix A. ER Diagram for Example
Database
Figure A-1 is an entity-relationship (ER) diagram for the
example database used in this book. As the name
suggests, the diagram depicts the entities, or tables, in
the database along with the foreign-key relationships
between the tables. Here are a few tips to help you
understand the notation:
Each rectangle represents a table, with the table
name above the upper-left corner of the rectangle.
The primary-key column(s) are listed first and are
separated from nonkey columns by a line. Nonkey
columns are listed below the line, and foreign key
columns are marked with “(FK).”
Lines between tables represent foreign key
relationships. The markings at either end of the lines
represents the allowable quantity, which can be zero
(0), one (1), or many ( ). For example, if you look at
the relationship between the account and product
tables, you would say that an account must belong to
exactly one product, but a product may have zero,
one, or many accounts.

Appendix B. MySQL Extensions to the SQL
Language
Since this book uses the MySQL server for all the
examples, I thought it would be useful for readers who
are planning to continue using MySQL to include an
appendix on MySQL’s extensions to the SQL language.
This appendix explores some of MySQL’s extensions to
the select, insert, update, and delete statements that
can be very useful in certain situations.
Extensions to the select Statement
MySQL’s implementation of the select statement
includes two additional clauses, which are discussed in
the following subsections.
The limit Clause
In some situations, you may not be interested in all of the
rows returned by a query. For example, you might
construct a query that returns all of the bank tellers
along with the number of accounts opened by each teller.
If your reason for executing the query is to determine the
top three tellers so that they can receive an award from
the bank, then you don’t necessarily need to know who
came in fourth, fifth, and so on. To help with these types
of situations, MySQL’s select statement includes the
limit clause, which allows you to restrict the number of
rows returned by a query.
To demonstrate the utility of the limit clause, I will
begin by constructing a query to show the number of
accounts opened by each bank teller:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 1 | 8 |
| 10 | 7 |
| 13 | 3 |
| 16 | 6 |
+-------------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.31 sec)

The results show that four different tellers opened
accounts; if you want to limit the result set to only three
records, you can add a limit clause specifying that only
three records be returned:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> LIMIT 3;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 1 | 8 |
| 10 | 7 |
| 13 | 3 |
+-------------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.06 sec)
Thanks to the limit clause (the fourth line of the query),
the result set now includes exactly three records, and the
fourth teller (employee ID 16) has been discarded from
the result set.
Combining the limit clause with the order by clause
While the previous query returns three records, there’s
one small problem; you haven’t described which three of
the four records you are interested in. If you are looking
for three specific records, such as the three tellers who
opened the most accounts, you will need to use the limit
clause in concert with an order by clause, as in:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> ORDER BY how_many DESC
-> LIMIT 3;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 1 | 8 |
| 10 | 7 |
| 16 | 6 |
+-------------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)
The difference between this query and the previous
query is that the limit clause is now being applied to an
ordered set, resulting in the three tellers with the most
opened accounts being included in the final result set.

Unless you are interested in seeing only an arbitrary
sample of records, you will generally want to use an
order by clause along with a limit clause.
Note ✎
The limit clause is applied after all filtering,
grouping, and ordering have occurred, so it will
never change the outcome of your select statement
other than restricting the number of records
returned by the statement.
The limit clause’s optional second parameter
Instead of finding the top three tellers, let’s say your goal
is to identify all but the top two tellers (instead of giving
awards to top performers, the bank will be sending some
of the less-productive tellers to assertiveness training).
For these types of situations, the limit clause allows for
an optional second parameter; when two parameters are
used, the first designates at which record to begin
adding records to the final result set, and the second
designates how many records to include. When
specifying a record by number, remember that MySQL
designates the first record as record 0. Therefore, if your
goal is to find the third-best performer, you can do the
following:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> ORDER BY how_many DESC
-> LIMIT 2, 1;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 16 | 6 |
+-------------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
In this example, the zeroth and first records are
discarded, and records are included starting at the
second record. Since the second parameter in the limit
clause is 1, only a single record is included.
If you want to start at the second position and include all
the remaining records, you can make the second
argument to the limit clause large enough to guarantee

that all remaining records are included. If you do not
know how many tellers opened new accounts, therefore,
you might do something like the following to find all but
the top two performers:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> ORDER BY how_many DESC
-> LIMIT 2, 999999999;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 16 | 6 |
| 13 | 3 |
+-------------+----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
In this version of the query, the zeroth and first records
are discarded, and up to 999,999,999 records are
included starting at the second record (in this case, there
are only two more, but it’s better to go a bit overboard
rather than taking a chance on excluding valid records
from your final result set because you underestimated).
Ranking queries
When used in conjunction with an order by clause,
queries that include a limit clause can be called ranking
queries because they allow you to rank your data. While I
have demonstrated how to rank bank tellers by the
number of opened accounts, ranking queries are used to
answer many different types of business questions, such
as:
Who are our top five salespeople for 2005?
Who has the third-most home runs in the history of
baseball?
Other than The Holy Bible and Quotations from
Chairman Mao, what are the next 98 best-selling
books of all time?
What are our two worst-selling flavors of ice cream?
So far, I have shown how to find the top three tellers, the
third-best teller, and all but the top two tellers. If I want
to do something analogous to the fourth example (i.e.,
find the worst performers), I need only reverse the sort

order so that the results proceed from lowest number of
accounts opened to highest number of accounts opened,
as in:
mysql> SELECT open_emp_id, COUNT(*) how_many
-> FROM account
-> GROUP BY open_emp_id
-> ORDER BY how_many ASC
-> LIMIT 2;
+-------------+----------+
| open_emp_id | how_many |
+-------------+----------+
| 13 | 3 |
| 16 | 6 |
+-------------+----------+
2 rows in set (0.24 sec)
By simply changing the sort order (from ORDER BY
how_many DESC to ORDER BY how_many ASC), the query
now returns the two worst-performing tellers. Therefore,
by using a limit clause with either an ascending or
descending sort order, you can produce ranking queries
to answer most types of business questions.
The into outfile Clause
If you want the output from your query to be written to a
file, you could highlight the query results, copy them to
the buffer, and paste them into your favorite editor.
However, if the query’s result set is sufficiently large, or
if the query is being executed from within a script, you
will need a way to write the results to a file without your
intervention. To aid in such situations, MySQL includes
the into outfile clause to allow you to provide the
name of a file into which the results will be written.
Here’s an example that writes the query results to a file
in my c:\temp directory:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\TEMP\\emp_list.txt'
-> FROM employee; Query OK, 18 rows affected (0.20 sec)

Note ✎
If you remember from Chapter 7, the backslash is
used to escape another character within a string. If
you’re a Windows user, therefore, you will need to
enter two backslashes in a row when building
pathnames.
Rather than showing the query results on the screen, the
result set has been written to the emp_list.txt file, which
looks as follows:
1 Michael Smith 2001-06-22
2 Susan Barker 2002-09-12
3 Robert Tyler 2000-02-09
4 Susan Hawthorne 2002-04-24
...
16 Theresa Markham 2001-03-15
17 Beth Fowler 2002-06-29
18 Rick Tulman 2002-12-12
The default format uses tabs ('\t') between columns
and newlines ('\n') after each record. If you want more
control over the format of the data, several additional
subclauses are available with the into outfile clause.
For example, if you want the data to be in what is
referred to as pipe-delimited format, you can use the
fields subclause to ask that the '|' character be placed
between each column, as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\TEMP\\emp_list_delim.txt'
-> FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
-> FROM employee; Query OK, 18 rows affected (0.02 sec)
Note ✎
MySQL does not allow you to overwrite an existing
file when using into outfile, so you will need to
remove an existing file first if you run the same query
more than once.
The contents of the emp_list_delim.txt file look as follows:
1|Michael|Smith|2001-06-22
2|Susan|Barker|2002-09-12
3|Robert|Tyler|2000-02-09
4|Susan|Hawthorne|2002-04-24
...
16|Theresa|Markham|2001-03-15
17|Beth|Fowler|2002-06-29
18|Rick|Tulman|2002-12-12

Along with pipe-delimited format, you may need your
data in comma-delimited format, in which case you would
use fields terminated by ','. If the data being
written to a file includes strings, however, using commas
as field separators can prove problematic, as commas are
much more likely to appear within strings than the pipe
character. Consider the following query, which writes a
number and two strings delimited by commas to the
comma1.txt file:
mysql> SELECT data.num, data.str1, data.str2
-> INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\TEMP\\comma1.txt'
-> FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
-> FROM
-> (SELECT 1 num, 'This string has no commas' str1,
-> 'This string, however, has two commas' str2) data;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)
Since the third column in the output file (str2) is a string
containing commas, you might think that an application
attempting to read the comma1.txt file will encounter
problems when parsing each line into columns, but the
MySQL server has made provisions for such situations.
Here are the contents of comma1.txt:
1,This string has no commas,This string\, however\, has two
commas
As you can see, the commas within the third column have
been escaped by putting a backslash before the two
commas embedded in the str2 column. If you run the
same query but use pipe-delimited format, the commas
will not be escaped, since they don’t need to be. If you
want to use a different escape character, such as using
another comma, you can use the fields escaped by
subclause to specify the escape character to use for your
output file.
Along with specifying column separators, you can also
specify the character used to separate the different
records in your datafile. If you would like each record in
the output file to be separated by something other than
the newline character, you can use the lines subclause,
as in:
mysql> SELECT emp_id, fname, lname, start_date
-> INTO OUTFILE 'C:\\TEMP\\emp_list_atsign.txt'

-> FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
-> LINES TERMINATED BY '@'
-> FROM employee;
Query OK, 18 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Because I am not using a newline character between
records, the emp_list_atsign.txt file looks like a single
long line of text when viewed, with each record
separated by the '@' character:
1|Michael|Smith|2001-06-22@2|Susan|Barker|2002-09-
12@3|Robert|Tyler|2000-02-
09@4|Susan|Hawthorne|2002-04-24@5|John|Gooding|2003-11-
14@6|Helen|Fleming|2004-03-
17@7|Chris|Tucker|2004-09-15@8|Sarah|Parker|2002-12-

29@18|Rick|Tulman|2002-12-12@
If you need to generate a datafile to be loaded into a
spreadsheet application or sent within or outside your
organization, the into outfile clause should provide
enough flexibility for whatever file format you need.

Combination Insert/Update Statements
Let’s say that you have been asked to create a table to
capture information about which of the bank’s branches
are visited by which customers. The table needs to
contain the customer’s ID, the branch’s ID, and a
datetime column indicating the last time the customer
visited the branch. Rows are added to the table whenever
a customer visits a certain branch, but if the customer
has already visited the branch, then the existing row
should simply have its datetime column updated. Here’s
the table definition:
CREATE TABLE branch_usage
(branch_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
cust_id INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
last_visited_on DATETIME,
CONSTRAINT pk_branch_usage PRIMARY KEY (branch_id, cust_id)
);
Along with the three column definitions, the
branch_usage table defines a primary key constraint on
the branch_id and cust_id columns. Therefore, the
server will reject any row added to the table whose
branch/customer pair already exists in the table.
Let’s say that, after the table is in place, customer ID 5
visits the main branch (branch ID 1) three times in the
first week. After the first visit, you can insert a record
into the branch_usage table, since no record exists yet
for customer ID 5 and branch ID 1:
mysql> INSERT INTO branch_usage (branch_id, cust_id,
last_visited_on)
-> VALUES (1, 5, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
The next time the customer visits the same branch,
however, you will need to update the existing record
rather than inserting a new record; otherwise, you will
receive the following error:
ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '1-5' for key 1
To avoid this error, you can query the branch_usage
table to see whether a given customer/branch pair exists
and then either insert a record if no record is found or
update the existing row if it already exists. To save you
the trouble, however, the MySQL designers have

extended the insert statement to allow you to specify
that one or more columns be modified if an insert
statement fails due to a duplicate key. The following
statement instructs the server to modify the
last_visited_on column if the given customer and
branch already exist in the branch_usage table:
mysql> INSERT INTO branch_usage (branch_id, cust_id,
last_visited_on)
-> VALUES (1, 5, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
-> ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE last_visited_on =
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.02 sec)
The on duplicate key clause allows this same
statement to be executed every time customer ID 5
conducts business in branch ID 1. If run 100 times, the
first execution results in a single row being added to the
table, and the next 99 executions result in the
last_visited_on column being changed to the current
time. This type of operation is often referred to as an
upsert, since it is a combination of an update and an
insert statement.
Replacing the replace Command
Prior to version 4.1 of the MySQL server, upsert
operations were performed using the replace
command, which is a proprietary statement that first
deletes an existing row if the primary key value already
exists in the table before inserting a row. If you are
using version 4.1 or later, you can choose between the
replace command and the insert...on duplicate
key command when performing upsert operations.
However, the replace command performs a delete
operation when duplicate key values are encountered,
which can cause a ripple effect if you are using the
InnoDB storage engine and have foreign key
constraints enabled. If the constraints have been
created with the on delete cascade option, then rows
in other tables may also be automatically deleted when
the replace command deletes a row in the target table.
For this reason, it is generally regarded as safer to use

the on duplicate key clause of the insert statement
rather than the older replace command.

Ordered Updates and Deletes
Earlier in the appendix, I showed you how to write
queries using the limit clause in conjunction with an
order by clause to generate rankings, such as the top
three tellers in terms of accounts opened. MySQL also
allows the limit and order by clauses to be used in both
update and delete statements, thereby allowing you to
modify or remove specific rows in a table based on a
ranking. For example, imagine that you are asked to
remove records from a table used to track customer
logins to the bank’s online banking system. The table,
which tracks the customer ID and date/time of login,
looks as follows:
CREATE TABLE login_history
(cust_id INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
login_date DATETIME,
CONSTRAINT pk_login_history PRIMARY KEY (cust_id,
login_date)
);
The following statement populates the login_history
table with some data by generating a cross join between
the account and customer tables and using the account’s
open_date column as a basis for generating login dates:
mysql> INSERT INTO login_history (cust_id, login_date)
-> SELECT c.cust_id,
-> ADDDATE(a.open_date, INTERVAL a.account_id *
c.cust_id HOUR)
-> FROM customer c CROSS JOIN account a;
Query OK, 312 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 312 Duplicates: 0 Warnings: 0
The table is now populated with 312 rows of relatively
random data. Your task is to look at the data in the
login_history table once a month, generate a report for
your manager showing who is using the online banking
system, and then delete all but the 50 most-recent
records from the table. One approach would be to write a
query using order by and limit to find the 50th most
recent login, such as:
mysql> SELECT login_date
-> FROM login_history
-> ORDER BY login_date DESC
-> LIMIT 49,1;

+---------------------+
| login_date |
+---------------------+
| 2004-07-02 09:00:00 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Armed with this information, you can then construct a
delete statement that removes all rows whose
login_date column is less than the date returned by the
query:
mysql> DELETE FROM login_history
-> WHERE login_date < '2004-07-02 09:00:00';
Query OK, 262 rows affected (0.02 sec)
The table now contains the 50 most-recent logins. Using
MySQL’s extensions, however, you can achieve the same
result with a single delete statement using limit and
order by clauses. After returning the original 312 rows
to the login_history table, you can run the following:
mysql> DELETE FROM login_history
-> ORDER BY login_date ASC
-> LIMIT 262;
Query OK, 262 rows affected (0.05 sec)
With this statement, the rows are sorted by login_date
in ascending order, and then the first 262 rows are
deleted, leaving the 50 most recent rows.
Note ✎
In this example, I had to know the number of rows in
the table to construct the limit clause (312 original
rows − 50 remaining rows = 262 deletions). It would
be better if you could sort the rows in descending
order and tell the server to skip the first 50 rows and
then delete the remaining rows, as in:
DELETE FROM login_history
ORDER BY login_date DESC
LIMIT 49, 9999999;
However, MySQL does not allow the optional second
parameter when using the limit clause in delete or
update statements.
Along with deleting data, you can use the limit and
order by clauses when modifying data as well. For
example, if the bank decides to add $100 to each of the

10 oldest accounts to help retain loyal customers, you
can do the following:
mysql> UPDATE account
-> SET avail_balance = avail_balance + 100
-> WHERE product_cd IN ('CHK', 'SAV', 'MM')
-> ORDER BY open_date ASC
-> LIMIT 10;
Query OK, 10 rows affected (0.06 sec)
Rows matched: 10 Changed: 10 Warnings: 0
This statement sorts accounts by the open date in
ascending order and then modifies the first 10 records,
which, in this case, are the 10 oldest accounts.

Multitable Updates and Deletes
In certain situations, you might need to modify or delete
data from several different tables to perform a given
task. If you discover that the bank’s database contains a
dummy customer left over from system testing, for
example, you might need to remove data from the
account, customer, and individual tables.
Note ✎
For this section, I will create a set of clones for the
account, customer, and individual tables, called
account2, customer2, and individual2. I am doing
so both to protect the sample data from being altered
and to avoid any problems with foreign key
constraints between the tables (more on this later in
the section). Here are the create table statements
used to generate the three clone tables:
CREATE TABLE individual2 AS
SELECT * FROM individual;
CREATE TABLE customer2 AS
SELECT * FROM customer;
CREATE TABLE account2 AS
SELECT * FROM account;
If the customer ID of the dummy customer is 1, you could
generate three individual delete statements against
each of the three tables, as in:
DELETE FROM account2
WHERE cust_id = 1;
DELETE FROM customer2
WHERE cust_id = 1;
DELETE FROM individual2
WHERE cust_id = 1;
Instead of writing individual delete statements,
however, MySQL allows you to write a single multitable
delete statement, which, in this case, looks as follows:
mysql> DELETE account2, customer2, individual2
-> FROM account2 INNER JOIN customer2
-> ON account2.cust_id = customer2.cust_id
-> INNER JOIN individual2
-> ON customer2.cust_id = individual2.cust_id
-> WHERE individual2.cust_id = 1;
Query OK, 5 rows affected (0.02 sec)

This statement removes a total of five rows, one from
each of the individual2 and customer2 tables, and
three from the account2 table (customer ID 1 has three
accounts). The statement comprises three separate
clauses:
delete
Specifies the tables targeted for deletion.
from
Specifies the tables used to identify the rows to be
deleted. This clause is identical in form and function
to the from clause in a select statement, and not all
tables named herein need to be included in the
delete clause.
where
Contains filter conditions used to identify the rows to
be deleted.
The multitable delete statement looks a lot like a select
statement, except that a delete clause is used instead of
a select clause. If you are deleting rows from a single
table using a multitable delete format, the difference
becomes even less noticeable. For example, here’s a
select statement that finds the account IDs of all
accounts owned by John Hayward:
mysql> SELECT account2.account_id
-> FROM account2 INNER JOIN customer2
-> ON account2.cust_id = customer2.cust_id
-> INNER JOIN individual2
-> ON individual2.cust_id = customer2.cust_id
-> WHERE individual2.fname = 'John'
-> AND individual2.lname = 'Hayward';
+------------+
| account_id |
+------------+
| 8 |
| 9 |
| 10 |
+------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
If, after viewing the results, you decide to delete all three
of John’s accounts from the account2 table, you need
only replace the select clause in the previous query with
a delete clause naming the account2 table, as in:

mysql> DELETE account2
-> FROM account2 INNER JOIN customer2
-> ON account2.cust_id = customer2.cust_id
-> INNER JOIN individual2
-> ON customer2.cust_id = individual2.cust_id
-> WHERE individual2.fname = 'John'
-> AND individual2.lname = 'Hayward';
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Hopefully, this gives you a better idea of what the delete
and from clauses are used for in a multitable delete
statement. This statement is functionally identical to the
following single-table delete statement, which uses a
subquery to identify the customer ID of John Hayward:
DELETE FROM account2
WHERE cust_id =
(SELECT cust_id
FROM individual2
WHERE fname = 'John' AND lname = 'Hayward';
When using a multitable delete statement to delete rows
from a single table, you are simply choosing to use a
querylike format involving table joins rather than a
traditional delete statement using subqueries. The real
power of multitable delete statements lies in the ability
to delete from multiple tables in a single statement, as I
demonstrated in the first statement in this section.
Along with the ability to delete rows from multiple tables,
MySQL also gives you the ability to modify rows in
multiple tables using a multitable update. Let’s say that
your bank is merging with another bank, and the
databases from both banks have overlapping customer
IDs. Your management decides to fix the problem by
incrementing each customer ID in your database by
10,000 so that the second bank’s data can be safely
imported. The following statement shows how to modify
the ID of customer ID 3 across the individual2,
customer2, and account2 tables using a single
statement:
mysql> UPDATE individual2 INNER JOIN customer2

This statement modifies four rows: one in each of the
individual2 and customer2 tables, and two in the
account2 table. The multitable update syntax is very
similar to that of the single-table update, except that the
update clause contains multiple tables and their
corresponding join conditions rather than just naming a
single table. Just like the single-table update, the
multitable version includes a set clause, the difference
being that any tables referenced in the update clause
may be modified via the set clause.
Note ✎
If you are using the InnoDB storage engine, you will
most likely not be able to use multitable delete and
update statements if the tables involved have foreign
key constraints. This is because the engine does not
guarantee that the changes will be applied in an
order that won’t violate the constraints. Instead, you
should use multiple single-table statements in the
proper order so that foreign key constraints are not
violated.

A note on the digital index ✎
A link in an index entry is displayed as the section
title in which that entry appears. Because some
sections have multiple index markers, it is not
unusual for an entry to have several links to the same
section. Clicking on any link will take you directly to
the place in the text in which the marker appears.

Colophon
The animal on the cover of Learning SQL, Second
Edition, is an Andean marsupial tree frog (Gastrotheca
riobambae). As its name suggests, this crepuscular and
nocturnal frog is native to the western slopes of the
Andes mountains and is widely distributed from the
Riobamba basin to Ibarra in the north.
During courtship, the male calls (“wraaack-ack-ack”) to
attract a female. If a gravid female is attracted to him, he
climbs onto her back and performs a common frog
mating hold called the nuptial amplexus. As the eggs
emerge from the female’s cloaca, the male catches the
eggs with his feet and fertilizes them while maneuvering
them into a pouch on the female’s back. A female may
incubate an average of 130 eggs, and development in the
pouch lasts between 60 and 120 days. During incubation,
swelling becomes visible, and lumps appear beneath the
skin on the female’s back. When the tadpoles emerge
from the pouch, the female tree frog deposits them into
the water. Within two or three months the tadpoles
metamorphose into froglets, and at seven months they
are ready to mate (“wraaaack-ack-ack”).
Both the male and female tree frog have expanded digital
discs on their fingers and toes that help them climb
vertical surfaces such as trees. Adult males reach 2
inches in length, while females reach 2.5 inches.
Sometimes they are green, sometimes brown, and
sometimes a combination of green and brown. The color
of the juveniles may change from brown to green as they
grow.
